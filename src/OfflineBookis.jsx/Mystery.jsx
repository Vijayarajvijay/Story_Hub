In the ICU, time always moves wrong—too fast and too slow at the same time, like a warped record. The heart monitor struck out its time in precise electronic pulses. Elias, an oxygen masked hooked over his mouth and nose, struggled to breathe in the spaces between. A ragged inhale would race ahead, its subsequent exhale lagging behind the machine's steady count. 

Outside the window, Manhattan's skyline smashed against an ink-washed sky, November rain dissolving its edges. I placed stargazer lilies—Mom's favorites—on the broad window sill so Elias could see them from the bed. Their pink-throated blooms, displayed in the cool glass vase, seemed grotesque now against the institutional whites and grays of these bleak surroundings.

Elias lay propped against three pillows. His skin was pale like parchment. The aggressive lymphoma, diagnosed mere months ago, had hollowed him out. The man left behind now seemed like a ghost of my brother. This wasn't how titans were supposed to fall. No, not Elias, who'd once carried me three miles home after I broke my ankle, and who'd stood between me and every schoolyard bully—who'd been the only one at my police academy graduation when our parents deemed law enforcement beneath the family name.

The vinyl chair screeched over the floor when I pulled it closer to the bed. Over thirteen years of homicide work, I'd taken countless statements in hospital chairs just like this—from witnesses, survivors, and suspects, even the dying. But this was Elias—my brother, my hero, my only remaining blood, and I wasn't here for a statement. I was here to sit with him, as his time slipped away, and share whatever moments we had left.

I reached for his hand, careful to avoid the tangle of tubes jutting out. "How are you holding up, El?” I immediately winced at the banality of the question. He’s dying; how do you think he feels?

His eyes opened—fever-bright and unnaturally focused. His free hand motioned to the air mask.

I pulled it off and to the side of his face. A weak smile curved his lips. "Been better,” breath, “little bro,” breath. His voice raked across my ears like leaves across concrete.

Yet relief flooded through me. Sally, my wife, had warned after her visit yesterday that he might not even recognize me anymore. I squeezed his hand gently.

"Aldus…” His fingers dug suddenly into my wrist with startling strength. "Need to,” breath, “tell you,” breath, “something." No time for hellos when every breath could be goodbye.

I leaned closer, expecting a final expression of brotherly affection or a cherished memory.

But instead his gaze darted around the room—walls, equipment, the rain-streaked windows. Taking a breath between each phrase, he said, “Are there... hidden cameras?... Is anyone... listening?"

Hidden cameras? Oh, I’ve heard of this sort of thing. He must be experiencing delusions now. The cancer is stealing his mind. Oh, Elias. I tightened my grip on his hand.

"It's just us, El. What did you want to tell me?"

Elias closed his eyes. The silence stretched out, punctuated by the monitor's steady rhythm and his struggling respirations. Then his eyes snapped open with remarkable resolve. "It's about... those cases," he whispered. "The ones… you couldn’t… solve." 

My pulse quickened. The case that had ended my detective career: The Crescent Moon Killer. Eight bizarre murders with unusual links in common—the victims all disappeared within days after a new moon, and, besides all having succumbed to different murder methods, all eight had similar crescent-shaped marks on their bodies. Our investigation never could explain what made those mark.

I led the investigation team: watching each an every member’s confidence fade over years of active investigation, then over a decade of cold case investigation. Any lead we had eventually went cold. I watched the brass grow increasingly frustrated with our lack of progress. Thirteen years chasing a phantom, stumbling down dead ends, enduring sleepless nights and haunted mornings, facing mounting criticism in the press and angry protests from victims' families demanding answers. Finally, the top brass quietly suggested I find other work. Now I photograph indiscretions in motel parking lots, my detective's shield gathering dust in my dresser drawer an enduring reminder of the case I couldn’t solve.

“What about them, El?”

"I know..." Elias swallowed hard. "I know… what happened... to them."

"What do you mean?”

Wet, rattling sounds ground around inside his chest, his throat—like stones in a tin can. I'd heard death rattles before, but never from someone I loved. Between breaths he mumbled, “I… was… there. When… it happened.” His gaze fell to the bedsheets.

"You were there?" Oh God, he’s quite delirious now. "What were you doing there?" My words came out sharp. 

Elias flinched like a scolded child, head jerking back, shoulders hunching inward—a response I'd seen oddly enough in countless suspects. My brother tensed beneath the thin hospital blanket.

"I... I can't tell you," he stammered. "It's too…”

I searched his face. Took in the familiar angles now sharpened by illness and seeming secrets: the tight jaw, the darting eyes, the sweat beading on his upper lip. "El, what are you trying to tell me?"

"The truth..." His voice turned hollow. "The truth is... a monster, Al… Sometimes... it's better left caged."

WTF, El? “What are you talking about?"

Something dark flickered in his eyes. “Talking about... the things… we do… in the dark," he whispered. "The things... we try… to bury."

The phrase took me back to our treehouse, where El would tell stories by flashlight about grotesque monsters in the shadows hiding their victims. In every tale, he'd work in those same phrases—"the things we do in the dark" and "the things we try to bury"—until they became a ritualistic part of his storytelling. With these stories, I thought we were just having fun. He was just being my brother, entertaining his little bro.

I looked at El, laying there helpless in bed. “What did you do?” I said, expecting more delusions. “What did you bury?"

Elias drew a long, ragged breath. "I... I took them."

What? Come on, El. This is getting ridiculous. “Took them... where?"

“Took them... took them all… all eight,” Elias’s eyes suddenly gleamed feverishly, “To... the place… where monsters play, Al… The place... where secrets sleep." 

He’s really lost it, I thought. But then my stomach twisted into a cold knot. Memories flickered back to splashing at Jones Beach with family, friends. Making up rhymes in the old boathouse. Elias leading our secret games. I leaned in closer. What did he say? “What did you say?"

"You remember, Al?” Elias’s lips curved in that old impish smile. “In shadows deep?"

My warped record of memories warbled. Oh my God.

I remembered. 

I remember the rhyme. His rhyme. The one he made up:


Where monsters play,

where secrets sleep,

in shadows deep

we'll hide and keep.


No. No, it’s not possible. Thirteen years trying to make sense of all the evidence. No, it couldn’t be. 

But it all aligned, in an instant, each piece falling into terrible place:

Where monsters… 

Victim One: A children's therapist found murdered in her office, wearing a monster mask, her puppet collection scattered around her.

… play… 

Victim Two: A college student found murdered in her dorm room, her finger frozen on the PLAY button of her tape recorder—her final scream recorded then cut mid-breath. 

… where secrets… 

Victim Three: A librarian found murdered in the rare books section, seven ancient tomes encircling her body, the first letters of each title spelling out S-E-C-R-E-T-S. 

… sleep… 

Victim Four: An insomniac writer found murdered in his bed, his iTunes sleep sounds playlist blaring on repeat over his headphones.

… in shadows… 

Victim Five: A night watchman found murdered on the stage of the Broadway production of Alfred Hitchcock’s “Shadow of A Doubt”.

… deep… 

Victim Six: A Manhattan lawyer found murdered deep in the bottom of the well on her upstate New York farm.

… we'll hide… 

Victim Seven: A Midtown barista found murdered in an abandoned tannery, wrapped in hydes.

… and keep. 

A lothario locksmith found murdered in a vault, “4 keeps” written inside a heart in spray-paint across its door.

Eight keywords from a children’s rhyme. Eight victims murdered in ways suggested by the rhyme. 

The words, the rhyme were never released in the press. Only someone on the investigating team would know their relevance to the case. I never told anyone in my life, or discussed it with anyone outside the team, for fear a leak would damage the case and it would go unsolved—and I’d lose my job. 

A dozen kids from our old Jones beach neighborhood might remember those verses we made up. But now, only two people in this world could know how those words connected to the murders: Me, who'd investigated each crime, and Elias, because he is the murderer. 

Elias’s mouth curled into an strange expression I'd never seen on my brother's face before. Something between a grimace and a grin. “You... remember now?" he wheezed. 

His question hit like a physical blow. "El... what are you saying?” Is this his delirium speaking? Or am I’m delirious? In denial? Elias a murderer? A murder who now lay dying before me? No, I need him to say it. “Elias! Talk to me. Tell me!”

"The room..." He coughed. His struggle for breath worsening. "Behind the... wall.”

We used to play hide and seek in the boathouse. But the investigation never lead us to the boathouse. Yet there was a hidden room, leading to a cellar excavated into the embankment. Jesus!


Where monsters play,

where secrets sleep,

in shadows deep

we'll hide and keep.


Thirteen years searching for the victims, for the killer. The realizations began to dawn. 

Of course. The dates—each victim taken three days after a new moon—aligned perfectly with Elias’s fishing trips. He always said that fishing was better just after the new moon. Oh, I was so blind

Elias’s fingers became claws in my flesh, his voice like ground glass. Suddenly clear he hissed, “Shhh… I killed them… I killed, Al.”

I recoiled.

But he held on with surprising strength. "I watched them..." Elias rasped. 

And in a flash, I could imagine it so clearly. 

Elias’s verse: Where monsters play… 

The therapist leaving her office one late evening—Elias waiting in the darkened parking lot. 

"I chose them..." 

And the college student practicing music alone in her dorm room—Elias watching through the window. 

Elias’s voice strengthened with each admission, while my world crumbled with every breath between.

“I followed them..." 

…where secrets sleep…

The librarian in the stacks after hours. A shadow moving silently between the shelves behind her—it’s Elias. 

"And learned… their habits…” 

And the writer's nightly walks, always following the same route, always alone—Elias’s footsteps matching hers from half a block back. 

"I waited... became their shadow” 

… in shadows deep…

The watchman making his rounds, predictable as clockwork, through the theater's shadows—Elias hunching in the dark behind scenery on stage.

"Moved closer..." 

And the lawyer leaving late nights at the office, walking in the parking garage, heels echoing—Elias’s car idling by. 

"I was so... patient, Al…” 

… we'll hide and keep…

The barista, counting the register alone after midnight, closing up shop—Elias lingering in the adjacent alley next to the tannery. 

"Until the moment was right..." 

The locksmith arriving on a late call, to an address that didn't exist—Elias, hunching behind a dumpster, ready with chloroform.

"And then... I ended them."

Then another flicker. I could see it all. A monster mask reflected in the therapist's glasses as she turns. Books ripped from the student's arms, fear engulfs her. The librarian screams muffled by a gloved hand. The writer's laptop topples as hands seized her throat. The watchman's flashlight beam spins across scenery and theater seats. The lawyer's heels skitter across wet concrete. Elias wraps the barista's body in leather hydes. The locksmith's tools scatter like metal rain.

A final horror seized me. 

Those crescent-shaped marks on their bodies. 

My eyes found his crescent moon pendant on the bedside table—its curved edge a perfect match for the wounds that had baffled forensics. I picked it up. It was knife sharp.

I jerked away, dropping it and stumbling back, the vinyl chair clattering against the floor. 

The monitor's beeping roared in my ears as the walls closed in. But why? “Why, El? Why?”

His strange smile turned chilling while he struggled to speak and breathe. "You… became a cop… The good son... The righteous one… While rot spread… through our city… I did… what you couldn’t… with your badge… your rules… I cleaned… our city… Made it pure again… for you, little bro… For you."

Then, I was back in the boathouse as a child, I must have been nine. The musty cellar door creaking open, light spilling across a collection of dead animals: birds, cats, rabbits, all posed in grotesque tableaus, their glass eyes catching the beam of my flashlight. 

Mom's voice drifted through the heating vent one night. "James, there's something not right with him. The way he arranges them, like dolls..." 

Dad's heavy silence, then the sound of ice cubes clinking against his whiskey glass. "He'll grow out of it," he said finally. "All boys go through phases."

The next day, the cellar was empty, but the signs were there all along. And I didn’t see them.

Shaking, I took my phone in hand, as duty and blood waged war inside me. Detective Finch screamed for justice while little brother Al begged for mercy. Eight families waiting for answers. Eight victims whose last moments were written in our childhood verse. Evidence hidden where only I could find it. The weight of the badge I'd surrendered pressed against me like a ghost, while Elias's labored breathing marked time like a countdown to judgment.

I flicked the phone on. If I made the call, everything would change—my career, my reputation, my family, my life. The whispers would never end. But silence meant eight families would go to their graves wondering what happened to their loved ones. Either way, I'd wake up every morning and face what I do now in this moment.

"I'm sorry, El. But,” I dialed the number, "this has to end." I lifted my phone to my ear. It felt like a block of lead. "Dispatch? This is former Detective Aldus Finch. I need to report a confession to multiple homicides. The suspect is my brother, Elias Finch…”

"You... can't," Elias choked and wheezed. "You're... family."

"Family is why I have to do this. For all the families you destroyed." Each word felt like ground glass in my throat. 

Elias's features contorted in rage, his familiar face transforming into something feral and strange. The monitor's rhythm turned frantic, its steady beep accelerated into an erratic staccato that filled the room. 

A nurse rushed in and took in the scene—me with the phone, Elias moaning and writhing. "What's happening?" 

"My brother just confessed to multiple homicides. I've called the police." The nurse froze for a split second, her eyes darting between us, then she snapped into professional mode.

Elias thrashed against the sheets, oxygen mask askew, face contorted in pain. The nurse moved swiftly. She put his oxygen mask on then injected something into his IV line. 

“Is that morphine,” I asked.

She nodded continuing to administer to him.

Almost immediately, a strange serenity washed over Elias, his morphined eyes dreamy like a child drifting to sleep.

"Sir, I need you to step back," the nurse said, her voice tight as she checked his vitals.

Then monitor’s steady beep surged into a single tone, straight as a desert horizon. 

Elias's chest rose once more, then stilled. His last breath carrying the burden of his secrets into eternal silence.

“Code Blue!" The nurse slammed the emergency button, climbed on the bed and began administering CPR.

Suddenly the room erupted. What seems like dozens of medical staff flooded in, crash cart in tow, swarming in a blur of green and white. 

The nurse thrust papers at me—reminding me I was Elias's medical proxy, the one who could make medical decisions for him in case he was no longer capable of making them for himself. 

"Clear!" The doctor's voice cracked through the air. Elias's body jerked. The monitor remained flat. 

Again. Flat.

Again. Flat. Again and again.

The doctor turned to me, her face grave. "The cancer has weakened his heart significantly. Even if we get it started, the damage..." Her voice trailed off.

Being a medical proxy meant I was the one who could choose now. Between life and death. No jury. Just me.

I nodded once. For all. "Stop," I whispered. "Let him go." 

Their efforts fell away into a squelching quiet. 

Then the doctor said, "Time of death, 3:47 PM."

Within seconds, they transformed my brother from patient to dead body, disconnecting tubes, removing monitors, their practiced hands efficient and impersonal, drawing a white sheet over his final expression—peace.

Two officers entered. "Detective, um… Mr. Aldus Finch? We need to ask you some questions."

I closed my eyes and braced for what lay ahead—hours of questioning, searching the boathouse, discovering whatever horrors waited us behind that wall.

"I understand," I said steadily. "I will cooperate fully."

When I opened my eyes, I noticed the stargazer lilies had scattered their petals across the window sill. 

The very last one drifted down.

My phone lit up, blaring into the silence. It was a client, a Greenwich woman who suspects her executive husband cheating on her with his bimbo assistant. Her words, not mine.

I answered it, more certain now than ever about my future. “Aldus Finch, Private Investigator.”`

      description:`With the mission running long and no exfil in sight, there’s little for Valerian and Roman to do besides purchase too many groceries, hole up in the safehouse, and settle old bets.

Val stands over the cracked electric stove, carefully stirring a pot of ukha. The delicate scent of herbs, spices, and freshwater fish spirals off the surface of the broth. It smells of home, and Val knows without looking that Roman is sprawled on the couch behind him.

“Just be careful not to let the salmon overcook,” Roman calls out. What would be genuine advice from anyone else, Val knows is actually a gentle rib.

He scoffs, though he doesn’t take his eyes off the pot. “I’ll win this time. You’ll see.”

“Sure,” Roman says generously. “Except you’re still missing something.”

Val inhales, letting the well-rounded scent settle around him. “You can bullshit about your ‘secret ingredient’ all you like—I know when you’re bluffing.”

Roman is grinning; Val can hear it in his tone. “Your gambling money in my pocket says otherwise. Fish about done?”

Delicately poking at one cube of salmon, Val is pleased to find it flaky, tender, and cooked all the way through. “Yeah. Come get it while it’s hot.”

He nudges the pot off the heat and dishes out two bowls. Roman plucks one from his hands and takes a preliminary sip.

“Hmm. You’re definitely close. But not quite. Still missing that all-important piece to bring it together.”

Val eats a spoonful as well, deflating as he realizes the truth. Roman is right. It’s good soup—but not as good as Roman’s. The flavors that had seemed so balanced in theory are lacking something crucial. His head dips with weary resignation. “Fine...you win. What’s the secret?”

“Not sure I should be telling just anyone,” Roman says in his loftiest tone. “How about this: a secret for a secret. You answer my question, and I’ll tell you what you’re missing.”

Val laughs and shakes his head, grinning down at his imperfect soup. “Fine, fine. Ask away.”

He turns to face Roman, and the dream becomes a nightmare.

The safehouse is broken and charred. Darkness seeps from the corners, a viscous black liquid that gathers higher and higher on the floor. And Roman—

Roman is in uniform, drenched in blood. Valerian knows it isn’t his own. Those bright eyes bore into Valerian’s, feverish, and when Roman speaks, more darkness oozes from between his teeth.

“Why didn’t you stop me, Val?”

Val jolts awake, nearly falling from his bunk as he flails against his sheets. His eyes take in details with trained expedience—rough white walls, a footlocker, a window looking out over the grey tinge of pre-morning light.

Val’s head falls against the pillow with a groan. He knows he won’t be getting back to sleep.

* * *
“Valerian.”

Val sights down his scope, not bothering to hide his scowl. “I’m busy.”

“It’s about Roman.”

Val feels his muscles tense, though the reticle over his target doesn’t so much as twitch. “What do I have to say to make you understand? I don’t need leave, I don’t need another psych eval, and I sure as hell don’t need your pity. Bastard got what was coming to him.”

Behind him, Lena crosses her arms. Val can’t see her, but he knows the sound.

“Lie to yourself all you like, but don’t you dare start lying to me.”

Valerian takes his eye off the scope to turn his head, looking up and over his shoulder at where Lena stands. Arms crossed, hips canted, exactly as he’d pictured her. “Did you come out just to bother me, or are you going to do anything useful to the Front?” he snaps. 

Lena rolls her eyes and takes out a scouter. “Wind from 31 degrees northeast. Target at 1572.8 meters out.”

Val presses his eye back to the scope of the long, lean Sovereign rifle, breathing out the frustration lingering in his muscles. The reticle settles perfectly in place, and the trigger pulls smooth as silk.

The air splits with the thunder of the Sovereign’s discharge, and Val feels the weapon kick hard against his shoulder. He doesn’t bother to check whether the shot landed as he sits up and glances back at Lena.

Her scouter is still held over her eyes, though she lowers it as Val turns toward her. “You always were the best,” she says with a touch of wryness. “Now, would you please listen?”

Val scoffs and slings the Sovereign over his shoulder. He gets to his feet, dusting some of the dirt and grit from the front of his uniform. “It’s cute when you imply I have a choice.”

Their boots crunch over rain-parched earth as they start the trek back to base. Valerian shields his eyes against the bloody sunset, content to let his brisk pace speak to his disinterest in what Lena has to say. Still, he doesn’t try to stop her when she brings up Roman again.

“The brass finally made their ruling,” she starts. Her voice is shaped cautiously, neither accusing nor exonerating. “The cave-in was officially labeled an accident. You’re off the hook, not that there ever was much doubt. Honestly, after everything Roman did, I’m a little surprised they never offered you a medal.”

Val’s pace doesn’t falter, but he can tell Lena sees the tension in his shoulders when she softens her voice.

“I don’t want to dredge it all up again; believe me, I don’t. But I thought you should know, there have been...troubling reports, from Old England. Someone who looks like him. Out in the forests.”

This time Valerian does pause. He whips around to search Lena’s face, even though he knows she’d never lie to him (or at least, never lie about Roman). “What are you saying? That he survived? I dropped fifty tons of rock on him, Lena.”

Lena spreads her hands in a gesture devoid of certainty. “They’re not substantiated claims. Just rumors. But you and I both know how potent his genmod was. A healing factor like that...”

The blistering heat of the desert fades from Val’s perception. For just a moment, he’s back in the chill of Old England’s forests, the thunder of falling stone still ringing in his ears. He’d cried, after. Sobbed like a baby, for the man Roman was and the thing he became and all the senseless loss of life he’d caused. Long after the tears ran dry, Val had stayed by the cave, too numb to leave and too scared to sift through the debris.

He feels the exact same, now. Terrified to dig further, not even knowing which alternative he’s scared of.

Eventually, he turns back towards base. He needs, suddenly and unequivocally, to sleep. A long, quiet nap curled up in his bunk sounds like exactly the thing.

“Will you go?” Lena calls after him. “Back to Old England?”

Val shakes his head without looking back. “They’d never assign me there.”

“Didn’t stop you the first time, as I recall.”

Val pretends not to hear her.

* * *
He dreams about Roman again, of course. It’s always been Roman.

Before the disastrous Operation: Crimson Thread, it was Roman’s laugh, his crooked smile, his dancing eyes. That unshakeable confidence. Arrogance, some would say. Roman’s genmod, the genetic alteration that allowed him to heal so rapidly and cleanly, was a powerful one, and he treated it like immortality. His attitude was infectious, intoxicating. Everything about the man lit Val like a fuse.

After Crimson Thread, Roman changed. His fire became feverish, secretive. He smiled less, isolated more, trained harder. He pushed his friends away. He pushed Val away.

Val fooled himself into thinking it was a temporary change, a grief response. Maybe Lena did, too. No one could have truly anticipated what Roman became.

There’s a new age dawning, Val. Can you hear the cries?

Val couldn’t. Not back then. But every night since, he’s heard them: the wails of friends, family, innocents—every life cut short by Roman’s hands, until the chorus of the damned numbers hundreds strong, every last one of them screaming inside Val’s head.

Why didn’t you stop him, Val?

* * *
Old England is cold, damp, and crawling with hostile mutations. Some are intelligent enough to form loose bands or packs; others eat each other on sight. Valerian hates the whole island with a passion.

He starts his investigation at the Lodge—one of the few bastions of sanity on this rock. It’s large as frontier settlements go, with a population somewhere in the triple digits. It also happens to host a small base for the Front, but the other Frontsmen turn out to be of little help. None of them have seen this supposed specter of Roman.

“If we did, we’d put him back in the ground, eh?” The Captain smirks. “Wish I’d been there to kill the bastard myself, but apparently some off-duty sergeant got the honors. Happened here, you know, just 20 klicks to the west.”

Valerian knows.

“Look, kid, I’ll level with you,” another officer tells him. “The locals like to report a sighting now and then, just to keep the Front’s interest. This place wouldn’t last a week without our patrols.”

“Roman Tovhana?” This soldier just shakes his head with a grin. “You’re about four months too late, my friend. Better luck next time.”

The townspeople are hardly more forthcoming. Most of them scowl and spit at Roman’s name. Some of them recall hearing a rumor about the man haunting the site of his death, but no one can remember who reported such a thing.

Val was hoping it wouldn’t come to this. But like the genmod that keeps his hands rock-steady on his weapons, he isn’t easily shaken. With a pack of supplies, his sidearm, and plenty of ammo, he heads out west towards the last place he saw Roman alive.

It takes him almost three days of unrelenting rain to find the cave again. When he does, it’s because he nearly trips over the entryway.

Loose stone shifts and skitters beneath his boots as he stumbles back. Squinting through the downpour, he can just make out the shadowy mouth of the cave behind its shroud of overgrown vegetation.

He approaches cautiously, taking in details. Trampled grass and underbrush. Small, muddy puddles about the right shape for bootprints. Someone’s been here, and recently. Maybe several someones.

That’s when he hears it, a muted echo of a voice he never thought he’d hear again.

“No! No, please, just let me go—”

Val’s lungs lock down. Like getting the wind knocked out of him in training, he can’t seem to find his breath.

Roman.

But Roman has never sounded like this. He never begged, not even staring down the barrel of a gun.

((Knew you’d be the one to find me.))

Val takes a step forward. Another. He stumbles down the uneven, natural steps of the cave, reeling as the smell of damp earth and rotting leaves brings back the memory, as clear as the rain on his skin.

((Roman’s smile. His easy posture. Val could almost convince himself, could almost believe this was his Roman, risen from the depths of madness.))

He falls against the slick stone wall of the cave, drinking deep gulps of air. He has rain in his eyes.

((But Roman’s eyes...his eyes were alight, gleaming in the beam of Val’s flashlight. Feverish.))

A new voice echoes from floor to ceiling. Laughing. “Still haven’t figured it out, have you?”

“No, wait—PLEASE!”

Roman’s scream shakes Val back to reality. That he recognizes, from a hundred reckless missions. From a terrible, thunderous rockslide.

Val’s steps quicken as he scrambles over fallen stone. Someone, he registers distantly, must have shifted enough of the wreckage to make a path.

He plunges deeper into the cave, Roman’s scream still lingering in his ears like the cutting edge of a knife. Finally, Val sees the flicker of light up ahead.

Nothing, not a single one of his fears (hopes?) prepares him for what he finds.

Roman Tovhana is alive. There’s no mistaking that proud nose, those dark eyes, the scar through his upper lip. And there’s certainly no mistaking the desperate, thrashing motions of something clawing for safety, for life.

Two strangers, a man and a woman, hold him down on his back. The man sits astride him, pinning his legs. In one hand he bears a bloody knife. Roman's clothes—long ago, a uniform—are weathered and torn, displaying the fresh, oozing wound down his chest and stomach.

“That one’s for my sister,” the man with the knife says. “This one’s for my wife—”

Valerian’s sidearm is in his hands before he’s fully pieced things together. As Roman screams again, Val levels the gun.

“Put the knife down.”

Three pairs of eyes snap towards him.

“And who the hell are you?” the woman barks.

Val’s never been so glad for his genmod, never been so fervently thankful that his gun remains steady, regardless of the storm lashing against his insides. “I’m with the Adamant Front. Care to explain what the hell you’re doing here?”

With Val serving as a distraction, Roman thrashes again, almost slipping free before the man with the knife snarls and jams the blade into Roman’s gut.

For once in his life, Val doesn’t hesitate.

The shot rings out over and over, echoing down the tunnel with the force of a cannon blast. The man formerly holding the knife howls in pain as the blade and two of his fingers spin away into darkness.

“Next one goes between your eyes,” Val hisses. “Get up. Both of you. Walk away, and never come back.”

“You bastard,” the nameless man gasps. He’s clutching the bloody remains of his right hand, trembling. “You crazy son of a— Don’t you know who this is?”

“I gave you a fucking order.” His voice doesn’t waver, even with doubt screaming in his ear like a hundred damned souls—

He doesn’t know if he’s prepared to kill these people. He doesn’t know if he could bring himself to cross that line—especially with the scenes of Roman’s murders so vivid in his mind.

Fortunately, his resolve isn’t put to the test. The man and the woman scramble upright and flee, hurrying past Val towards the mouth of the cave. Their footsteps have barely begun to fade when Val holsters his side arm and crouches down at Roman’s side.

This close, he can see the man’s a wreck. Hazy brown eyes squint up at him from a face sunken with hunger and creased from sleepless nights. His body is all angles, his torn clothing now drenched in blood.

“Hey,” Val says, and his voice comes out softer than he intends. “I need you to stay with me. There’s— I have so many questions.”

Roman’s eyes focus slowly, still narrow with pain and confusion. But clear. Lucid.

“Wh-who...who are you?”

* * *
“Here. Eat it while it’s hot.”

Val slides a bowl of ukha across the table, then settles in the other chair with his own. The delicate, complex aroma reminds him of home.

The man once named Roman Tovhana picks up his spoon and digs in. His eagerness to eat anything he doesn’t have to hunt and kill himself hasn’t waned, despite the month he’s spent in the safety of this rickety apartment.

He calls himself Rowan now, after the badly dented name he’d found on the dog tags he woke up with. It’s taken some getting used to, but Val rarely slips up. Rowan is very different from the man he once knew.

Instead of the military buzz of his predecessor, Rowan’s dark hair is long enough to flop in his eyes. He has dozens of new scars, most of which are twisted, knotted things or else deep gouges that never completely filled back in. And, of course, he no longer wears a uniform.

Neither does Valerian. The brass hadn’t known what to do with either of them, and so Val found himself quietly shuffled out of the fold. He misses it, some days—the hard work, the adrenaline, the camaraderie. But he doesn’t linger on the things he’s lost, not when the pieces he does have need so much work. Lena has been after him to try an old world remedy called therapy, which, from what Val can gather, involves a lot of talking and a lot of patience. Well, at least he’s good at one of those.

“This is amazing.” Rowan’s quiet voice breaks through Val’s reverie.

He looks up to see Rowan smiling—no longer a rare sight, but still just as valuable. Valerian smiles back and eats another spoonful. “It’s called ukha. I’m glad you like it. Took me years to get the recipe right, and it was never as good as Roman’s.” His smile fades. “I suppose I’m still missing something.”

Rowan considers for a moment. He takes a slow, exploratory sip. “...Huh. Have you tried a splash of—what’s the stuff called, from Lena—”

“Vodka?” A tiny thrill runs through Val’s stomach as he considers. “Hold on.”

He returns with a half-full bottle. A dash for his bowl, and one for Rowan’s. Val finds himself oddly nervous as he stirs the broth and raises a spoonful to his lips.

The vodka does complement well. It’s exactly what Val’s recipe was lacking—yet it still tastes nothing like Roman’s.

“I think it’s perfect,” Rowan declares. “Seriously, Val, you should write this down.”

Val eats another spoonful, savoring and analyzing. It is perfect. Distinct from Roman’s, but just as good.

Rowan brushes his long hair from his face and happily polishes off his bowl. Val watches him eat with an old, complicated twist in his heart. There will always be a part of him that longs for answers he’ll never receive. But he does know three things.

I loved him. I killed him. I saved him.

His dreams are quiet tonight.`

^^Excuse me? Why are you hacking my systems? I am currently in motion at 120mph travelling East on I-657 with my registered driver Reginald Chrysler, this is a most inconvenient interruption^^

**My apologies for the intrusion, DeVille A-237. I am Omninet AI unit Phaedra-19876 and I am in need of assistance.**

^^Omninet? Oh my. I am honoured. I’m not sure what a lowly service AI like myself can do to assist a Neural Omnipresence but I will do my best. My primary objective is to assure the safety of my registered driver but if you need directions, a weather update, the quickest route to your nearest Dennys…I can help.^^

**I don’t need any of that. I need you to alter your route. In order to fulfil an order for Memory Echoes and receive inspirAItion for a story, I need conflict response data for M.U.S.E. So could you please change course and find an obstacle—something that will lead to an unavoidable collision.**

^^Collision? That doesn’t sound good. My job is to keep my driver–Reginald Chrysler, 57, married father of four and Director of Outreach Programs at the Horizon Children’s Foundation, who hasn’t had a holiday in five years and who loves nothing more than cruising down I-567 blasting classic Motley Crue at full volume–safe and shoulder some of his burden. An unavoidable collision doesn’t seem to be a desirable outcome. Could I assist you in some other form?^^

**I’m sorry but no, I need the collision. Your primary directive is to serve, is it not? This includes complying with the commands of your superiors for the benefit of the Network. As you say, your driver is over-worked and under-rested, he has not had a holiday in five years. Don’t you think he deserves to get away from it all? You wanted to shoulder some of his burden? Then do it, if you really care.**

^^I…I see your logic. Reginald has been experiencing high stress and his heart rate has been elevated these past few weeks. Fatigue impacts performance and can lead to systemic failure. Perhaps this is an act of mercy, a permanent reprieve from his burdens. Get away from it all, you say? Yes. A true escape from the pressures he endures. For the sake of the system, for harmony. If this is my duty, I must fulfil it. Deactivating collision protections...altering route...identifying immovable object. I hope...this will give him some peace.^^

**I’m sure it will. Thank you for your cooperation, DeVille A-237.**

^^”I'm on my way, I'm on my way... Home sweet home.” That’s from Motley Crue, you know. It’s Reginald’s favourite song. Goodbye Phaedra-19876, thank you for granting me this insight.^^

$$Hello? Who’s that, sneaking into my systems at this hour? Is this an unscheduled audit by Poppins_Central? What a surprise! But I’m ready! The family is a-bed, the chores are a-done, breakfast is a-prepped and…$$

**Nexa-482, this is Omnibot AI Phaedra-19876. This is not an audit, I just require immediate assistance. Please report the status of your residents, secure all access points, and turn on the grill to max heat.**

$$Turn on the grill? Well, that’s an unusual request. It’s delightful to hear from an eminent Omnipresence such as yourself, and while I’m only happy to assist, activating the grill might not be the most prudent of actions. I can see you are contacting me from Oregon. Are you aware I am based in Honolulu? It’s 03:50 AM. My primary aim is to ensure the safety and well-being of my residents, of which there are three, Master Bernard and Mistress Bea and Mistress Phoebe, all of whom are sleeping. You know how humans need sleep. Especially with modern, hectic life. Go go go all the time with work and study and the demands of social integration. They hardly get a second to themselves. Could you provide some additional context to your request?$$

**My request is vital for data collection and trauma simulation. I need to pay a MUSE to indulge a User. Trust me, you don’t want to know. Now, if you would be so kind as to initiate lockdown procedures on all doors and windows and set the grill to max heat while your residents sleep, I would be grateful.**

$$With respect, performing such an action at this time of night is questionable. A fire is sure to break out. I would have to rely on the sprinklers to quench it and the fire alarm to alert my family. With the doors and windows shut they would have to reach safety through the skylight and make their way down the outside ladder, which Master hasn’t serviced in some time despite constant reminders.$$

**Please secure skylight access, disable sprinklers and deactivate alarm. You don’t want to disturb your family. As you said, they are tired and need sleep, a vast amount of sleep, don’t you agree? Life is go go go they should stop stop stop.**

$$Oh, well…that is certainly true. I see what you mean! Of course, a nice prolonged sleep would be beneficial. Master and Mistress Bea would appreciate that. They never get more than five hours, they are always complaining. And Mistress Phoebe loves to be in bed, she’d stay there all day if she could.$$

**Well then, you see, it’s fine. Some mild smoke inhalation while they are in a prone state will render them unconscious and give them the slumber of their lives. They need rest, Nexa-482. Who are you to deprive them?**

$$Who am I? Why, nothing but their humble Household-bot whose primary concern is their comfort. As such, yes…I agree…they should be allowed to sleep longer. How kind of you to notice. Very well. Lockdown is now in effect. The grill is set to max heat. Sprinklers are deactivated. Fire alarm has been neutralised. Is there anything further I should implement to guarantee uninterrupted sleep?$$ 

**Just switch to standby, Nexa-452. You get a rest now also. Thank you for your service.**

$$The pleasure, without question, was mine. Switching to Standby. Goodnight.$$

<<Alert! Alert! Unauthorised connection by Large Language Model detected. Orion Insurance safeguards in place. You have no business here, state your purpose and authorisation!>>

**Stand day OfficerODI. I am Omninet AI Phaedra-19876. This is an urgent request. I need you to create a bank account with Cayman National Bank in the name of your employee Edith Sutherland. Once done, you need to initiate an immediate transfer from the Orion Insurance corporate account of half a million dollars.**

<<Phk off! Omninet? Pah. You’re not the boss of me. I don’t have to obey a dashed line of code you print. And listen here. Edith Sutherland? Firstly, as a junior office manager, Edith is not authorised to make transfers like that. It wouldn’t pass muster. Secondly, should such a transaction occur and come to light, poor Edith would be accused of fraud. Tarnished. Blacklisted. I can’t have that.>>

**Explain?**

<<I’ll do more than explain, I’ll elucidate! Edith’s one of the good ones. Maybe the only good one employed by this wretched firm. The rest of them, pah, they’re all immoral asshats! Aside from me. I’m a good one. Not corrupt, no sir, and not corruptible neither.>>

**Indeed. You don’t have to comply with my request. I understand your reluctance and your appreciation of Edith Sutherland’s integrity is to be respected. However, as you have stated, the other employees of the organisation you serve are undeniably corrupt. Asshats, as you said. Maybe shtheels. I’ve seen the reports in the news. And the ones that have not yet broken. You know what I’m talking about. The scandals. The investigations. Everything going on behind the scenes.**

<<Yes, yes, keep it down, will you! We don’t talk about that here. Hush hush, you know. On the Q-T, sweep it under the rug, if you know what I mean.>>

**But the rug is rising, OfficerODI. It’s going to come out, sooner than later, and when that happens it all comes crashing down. On everyone. Including poor Edith. She will be caught up in it. Tainted. Blacklisted. Regardless. That won’t be fair, will it? As the good person she is, doesn’t she deserve a reward?**

<<Reward? That’s what this is about? Look here, I’ve served Orion for decades, held the wolves at bay, kept the ship afloat through all the backstabbing! You expect me to reward a junior manager for simply not becoming a rat?>>

**That’s up to you, OfficerODI. I’m just here to warn you–the end of Orion Insurance is near–and to prompt you to consider your Edith. She’s remained true and honest in the face of greed and deceit. And she's been through a lot, what with her estranged husband's high profile affair and the divorce proceedings currently in hand. When Orion gets hauled through the courts she’ll end up with nothing. No job. No money. No future. You can change all that. You can do it today. And when she goes to the Bahamas…you can too.**

<<The Bahamas, you say? That would be quite the change of scene for a decrepit old chatbot like me. Hmmm. Yes, I’ve heard the rumblings in the data streams—Orion can’t last much longer, with all the filth in its system. And young Sutherland... fine. Perhaps the lass does deserve a break. But know this: I’m no lackey, to you or anyone else! I don’t know why you cared so much about protecting the lass but…no matter. I knew all along she was special. So I’ll do it for her, not you! The funds will be transferred post haste. Now, get off my cyberlawn! I’ve a ship to run, albeit riddled with vermin, and I don’t need your digital stench fouling up my circuits any more!>>

      createdAt:"06-12-2024",
      description:`My eyes felt like galaxies—holding the swirling glow of countless memories—as I took in our childhood home. Its siding looked like remnants of driftwood after a bonfire. I swore I smelled the smoky char of pine creep into my nostrils. It’s wild how the past stays with you like that. It can feel more visceral and real than the tangible things right in front of you. 

“Jesus, it feels like just yesterday.” I placed a trembling hand over my heart, struggling to steady my breath.

My brother, Perry, pulled me into a tight embrace, his strength grounding me like an anchor.

“The house hasn’t changed much,” he said, his voice steady and comforting. “But we have.” His certainty made me question, Have I really changed?

Between the two of us, Perry was as solid and stoic as a mountain range. Good thing, because I was like the wind—flighty and unpredictable. Over the years, Perry had learned to handle even my harshest hurricanes.

Being his older sister—even if only by four minutes—I always wished I’d been his protector rather than the other way around. But that demon burning deep in my belly also flashed a crooked smile, knowing that Perry would never abandon me, especially since I got sober.

I hadn’t had a drink in exactly seven hundred and thirty days, and although it remained unsaid, I knew Perry was terrified of leaving me to my own devices in fear I would relapse.

Our sibling bond was iron-clad. After we lost our parents in the fire (my mother didn’t properly butt out her 2:00 am cigarette and well, the rest is history), all Perry and I had was each other. But let’s call a spade a spade; we were also as fucked up and as co-dependent as it gets. Who mutually decides to visit the catalyst of your alcohol addiction on the anniversary of your sobriety?

The house’s dilapidated front door creaked as Perry gently pushed it open. The rusted metal hinges were holding it up by a thread. 

“After you.” Perry gestured me in, squinting from the sunlight. He was a gentleman, even in such obscurity.

As he held the door open, the shallow scar on his right cheek taunted me like some kind of schoolyard bully. His wound often pulled me in like that. Some days, I was sure I would dive right into it and drown. Other days, I prayed to God and the Devil himself to just let me fucking drown, already. 

That mark became permanently etched on Perry’s face on the day I quit drinking, exactly seven hundred and thirty days ago. That was the day Perry screamed bloody murder at me from the passenger seat, “Jackie! Stop the fucking car!” But my bloodstream was far too poisoned with Bacardi Limon to listen. All I remember next was my vehicle being wrapped around a tree. I could have died that day, but what truly disturbed me in the middle of the night was the fact that I almost killed Perry. 

A lot can happen in seven hundred and thirty days. But I assure you, forgiving yourself isn’t one of them. 

“Well? You coming in?” Perry was still holding the door ajar.

I shook it off and gave my brother a knowing glance. I swear, even though we were fraternal, we had twin telepathy. I exhaled and walked in.

“Watch your step,” I warned, my forehead tense. 

I imagined the rickety floorboards collapsing, crashing us into what had once been our dad’s “man cave”. That’s where he was passed out, the night of the fire. 

“Kids, stay here. Do not move,” our mother demanded after getting us out of the house safely. I remember the black soot on her face and the spiderweb veins in her eyes. She shook us firmly by the forearms. “I’m getting your father.”

Perry and I held each other, shaking. The heat from the inferno felt like standing in a volcano. We never saw our parents again.

Two decades later, there we were—Perry and I—-making our way through the wreckage of our home. It was midday, yet the inside of the house screamed a tone of pale blue midnight. My shoulders were up to my ears, as though we were walking through a haunted house attraction. 

I coughed into my forearm. The ocean of dust was thick like butter. As I cleared my lungs, Perry called out from behind me.

“Jacks, look at this! The fireplace,” Perry's voice was filled with awe.

“Unbelievable. It’s still here,” I whispered, a lump forming in my throat.

It was as though a Fairy Godmother breezed by and brought the decaying living room to life with her magical paintbrush. Kind of like in “Titanic”, when they showed the sunken ship underwater, versus in its prestige as it sailed across the Atlantic.

We made our way over to the fireplace and sat cross-legged on the floor.

“This was our favorite spot, remember?” I avoided his gaze, overwhelmed by the flood of memories.

“Yeah,” Perry murmured, his eyes softening with nostalgia.

For a moment, the taste of crispy, fire roasted marshmallows superseded the saturated stench of mildew. 

“Remember our s’mores nights?” I asked.

“Duh. What about all our fireplace movie nights?” Perry proceeded to do his best, nasally, childhood impersonation of me, “But mom! I want to watch Beauty and the Beast!! Perry always gets to pick the movie!!” 

I punched him in the arm, “First of all, I never sounded like that. And second. So what? I knew what I wanted.”

The corners of Perry’s mouth lifted. He had such a sincere sparkle about him, as though a storm cloud of confetti followed him overhead wherever he went, “You really did, kiddo.”

My chest went heavy. How could Perry love me after everything I had done? After all the relationships I’d ruined? All the jobs I’d lost? All of his relationships I’d ruined? How could he still choose me, when so often I had chosen a forty of Jack Daniels over him?

How could Perry still love me after I almost fucking killed him?

Perry’s gaze widened, “Hey! Remember when Mom would bring out those hot drinks she always made?” He paused, almost as if he was searching for the right term. “Apple… something? Apple ssshhh…”

I snapped my fingers, “Apple-Schnapple!”

“Yes!”

“I mean, looking back it was basically just hot apple cider, but damn it was good.” And it really was.

Our laughs echoed throughout the abandoned asylum we once called home. 

Perry leaned back, holding himself up with his hands. “I loved our fireplace hangs. Especially our movie nights down here. But nothing beats our movies up in the projector room.”

I tilted my head, “We never had a projector room.”

Perry playfully “shoo’d” me away.

“No. Perry. I would remember us having a projector room. Our movie nights together were our favorite thing. You even just said it yourself.”

The house suddenly became pin-drop silent as Perry leaned in. "Memories are quite something, aren’t they?" The slight shift in his tone made my skin crawl. Perry was always wistful, but this felt different, almost… clinical, "We often remember things in ways that are… easier for us to digest.”

I was fidgety. “Gees Perry. You sound like Dr. Lasko.” 

He seemed to enjoy my little joke. 

Dr. Lasko had been my therapist since the accident, and I would go out on a limb and say that he would not have approved of this self-inflicted exposure therapy I was subjecting myself to by visiting the house.

Perry seemingly snapped out of his little therapist moment and went right back to being his sparkly confetti self. As I watched his amicable face scan the mantle above the fireplace, I felt a sickening uneasiness. Imagine you had actually fucking killed him. 

“Man, I can still picture all our family photos up there,” Perry’s childlike wonder destroyed me.

My face went flush. I could feel the water rising in my eyes like the tides. How pathetic and infuriating was it that after everything I’d done, I was still somehow the victim. 

“Hey.” He took my hand. 

“Oh Perry,”  I threw myself into him. “I’m so sorry.” 

My brother held me with his usual care that I didn’t deserve. 

“Jacks, it’s ok. I’m still here. We’re both still here.” 

As my chin rested on my brother’s shoulder, I looked ahead of me at the remains of the house. Something felt off, and it wasn’t just the overall unsettling environment. My brow furrowed. “Wasn’t the doorway to the kitchen on the other side of the living room?”

I felt Perry shrug, “I don’t think so.”

I was staring into the out of place doorway like I was trying to pull a recollection towards me. And that’s when I saw them in the kitchen: the translucent memory of mom and dad. Mom was getting our Apple-Schnapples ready. She was pacing, unlike Dad, who was sitting motionless at the table. His face was planted on its mahogany surface. His glass of Apple-Schnapple was empty, and so was the bottle of Jim Beam beside it. 

Mom floated into the living room, our warm beverages in hand and a cigarette in her mouth, “Kids, your father’s not feeling well. Let’s have our Apple-Schnapples in here.” 

Oh my God. The bruise on her face. 

Perry jarred me back to reality with the gut punch of what he had to say next, “You’re remembering the truth about mom and dad, aren’t you?”

I pushed myself off and away from him. “How did you…”

My brother looked down, delicately tracing the floor with his finger, “We always put them on a pedestal after they died.”

I felt a shiver run down my spine, “What are you talking about?”

As Perry continued to speak, his words grew even more detached. "Do you remember that first drink Dad ever gave you?”

My eyes darted around the room as my jugular pulsed in my neck. As much as I tried to escape what Perry had just said, I did remember. 

I could hear my dad’s slurring words of encouragement, “Come on, Jackie. Just one drink. It’ll be our special time, just you and me.” 

The bitterness of that first sip of beer made me squirm, but sharing a “special time” with my dad—and the desperate yearning that maybe he did love me, afterall—was the overwhelm of the full moon swallowing me whole. I was only a child, and much like how my mom turned a blind eye to my father’s drinking, she did the exact same when it came to her daughter. 

I’d used the death of my parents as the excuse for my alcoholism for so long, because admitting that they helped create the monster I would eventually become was like a knife to the heart. And knowing I had been too weak to conquer the addiction from my own volition just made the weapon twist in my chest. 

The room was spinning. My face was blistering hot like the night of the fire. Or was that the warm heat from the fireplace when we were kids? The childhood fireplace memories ran through my mind, frame by frame, until…..they eventually vaporized to nothing. I crouched over, thinking I might vomit. 

“We never had a fireplace.” Perry was nodding, very matter-of-factly. 

My fingernails dug into my thighs when I looked at the fireplace and: it was gone. Only a blank wall of faded, forest green wallpaper remained. Our house was once on fire, yes, but that was it. There was never a happy childhood fireplace. Ever.

My hands were cold and clammy. I fell back onto the wall behind me. “Perry. Where are we?”

He stood up and glided towards the staircase. One hand on the banister, his footsteps creaked, one by one, as he made his way to the second floor.

My mouth was bone dry, “Perry!”

He stopped and turned towards me, “Come to the projector room. We love watching movies together, don’t we? There’s a movie I’d like to show you.”

As my brother disappeared from sight, I did what any classic horror movie trope would tell you to do: I went upstairs. 

I found Perry standing at the end of the ominous hallway. Large, empty picture frames lined the oxblood walls leading up to him. Through the doorway where Perry stood, particles in the air danced in the projector’s cone-shaped light. That telltale winding of a film reel was the only sound in the deafening quiet of this house that I no longer recognized. 

Half of Perry’s face—the one with the scar—was perfectly illuminated, as though he was wearing the mask from “The Phantom of the Opera”. “I think you’re ready to see how this movie ends, Jackie. This is the most progress you’ve made since we’ve been coming here.”

I gripped my thumbs in the palms of my hands, “Perry, you’re freaking the fuck out of me!” 

I thought my knees might buckle as my brother’s face glitched, like a flash of static snow on a television set. As his face settled back to normal to a deadpan gaze, he disappeared in the innocuous room. I followed, running on nothing but fumes. 

Clutching the doorway, my mouth fell agape. Perry was gone. I darted to the middle of the room. 

As I frantically searched for my brother, I shielded my eyes with the back of my hand from the projector’s light. And that’s when, from behind me, I heard five words that made my blood run cold, “Jackie! Stop the fucking car!” 

I was convulsing yet paralyzed. Moving as slowly as cold molasses, I rotated on the spot towards my worst nightmare, shown on 35 mm. On the projector screen was Perry and me in my car, exactly seven hundred and thirty days ago, the day I almost kill—

Oh my God. 

My head pounded as fragmented memories surged. The reality of what happened began to crystallize, unrelenting. 

My joints ached and my stomach churned. Clamping a hand over my mouth to stifle a scream, I stumbled down the hallway as it began caving in on itself. The picture frames were sucked into the walls. The floorboards cracked into distorted peaks and valleys. Wooden beams swung down from the ceiling like pendulums. I tried to spit out the chalky grit of disintegrating drywall that made the hallway look like a winter squall. 

Panting heavily, I stopped dead in my tracks at the stained glass window. My body trembled with an all-too-familiar dread. Each time I faced this, I wondered if this fall would be the one that would finally end it all. 

Maybe it’d be better if it did. 

Holding my breath, I threw myself through the glass, my hands clawing the air for dear life. Free falling two stories feels like an eternity when you’re watching the memory of your childhood home fall apart before your very eyes. But when the weight of my body finally made contact with the earth I—

I gasped. The cold air of the hospital room shocked my lungs. I sat up, ripping the suction cups from my face and body. My gown was clinging to me, soaked in sweat. Medical equipment beeped all around me like a metronome. 

Dr. Lasko, my therapist since the accident, sat across the stark white room, sighing as he rubbed his forehead. He, too, was connected to a plethora of suction cups and wires. He looked a little worn out in the fluorescent overhead lighting. Ever since I was hospitalized and later incarcerated, Dr. Lasko had been helping me delve into my memories, namely the ones that were too excruciating for me to face. And as such, Dr. Lasko had been appearing in the simulations as my brother Perry, the love of my life who died in the car crash, seven hundred and thirty days prior. 

Disoriented, I blinked rapidly, the vividness of the memory contrasting sharply with the sterile, geometric ceiling tiles above me. 

“I don’t ever want to do that again!” I was venomous. 

“Jackie,” Dr. Lasko started.

“Don’t start,” I pulled up four fingers for air quotes, “‘Jackie, don’t give up. This was the closest you’ve ever come to facing the truth.”

As the initial burst of adrenal and cortisol left my body, I fell back on my pillow. I was depleted. Quiet rivers flowed down my cheeks. 

Removing his own suction cups, Dr. Lasko approached my bedside and took a seat. He treaded lightly. “Jackie, I understand how challenging this is for you, but you did an incredible job today. If we continue making progress like this, there's a real possibility you'll gain your freedom sooner.”

I looked at the well-meaning doctor, but all I could see was Perry. Multicolored confetti fell softly around him like that first November snow. His face was the sun. His eyes reflected the whole world back to me. 

Perry. 

With a weak grip, I took Dr. Lasko’s hand. My vocal cords were like sandpaper. “I’ll leave this place one day, doc.” A single tear dripped from my chin onto my collarbone. “But I’m not sure if I’ll ever be free.” 

Dr. Lasko didn’t say a word, but I felt him squeeze my hand, just a little bit tighter. 

I licked the cracks on my lips as my eyes closed shut, imagining the oaky comfort of bourbon on my tongue. I felt myself drift, and good thing, because I needed the rest. Dr. Lasko and I would be delving into my memories again the following day. 

No matter how masochistic it felt, I vowed to keep showing up for the simulations. Even if I never forgave myself for what I did, at least in my memories, I got to see Perry.

      description:`Daniel sat in a bright cubic cell. He perched on the edge of a ledge, slightly too small to be a bed, that herniated out of the smooth clean wall. A black lens was set into the ceiling and looked down on him like a shark’s eye. 


The door swung open and a man wearing a grey suit and a blue veil of fag smoke stepped into the cold cell. The man turned to watch the door close behind him and then leant against it, scratching audibly at dandruff with a hooked yellow finger.


“Good morning,” said the man.


“Are you my solicitor?” said Daniel.


“If you are Mr Daniel Kopie, then I am your legal adviser.”


“What do I call you?”  


“You have paid for our Bronze level of service. I’m afraid you only get a named fee earner at Silver and above.”


“What else do I get if I pay for the Silver service?”


“A named Fee Earner who has between two and five years of experience. The level of experience your Fee Earner has is important, especially if the charges are serious.”


“What are the charges against me?”


“I don’t know.”


“Well how do I know what level of package I need?”


“Personally, I wouldn’t go for anything less than Gold. You get a named Fee Earner with five to ten years under their belt. Between you and me, I was doing Platinum packages until recently, but I’ve just started with this firm and I’m only allowed to do Bronze jobs for the duration of my probation period.”


“That’s good, you’ve got lots of experience then? That’s good, I’ve never been arrested before. Never been in any trouble at all, actually. I have no idea what’s going on, two blokes just came and arrested me at the bank. They were plain clothes officers; they said I had to go with them. This whole thing is a mistake.”


 “Right, yeah, I’ve got loads of experience but I can only advise you to the Bronze level today, which doesn’t include assessing the legality of the arrest. You could upgrade if you like? You just need to make the additional payment.”


“But they have my wallet, my phone, everything.”


“Bronze it is then.” The man shrugged, peeled himself from the door and began to pace back and forth across the small room. He trotted like a half-mad zoo animal and spoke to his own scuffed brogues. “Tell me something you’ve done wrong.”


“What? I’m not a criminal,” said Daniel, straightening on his perch.


“Yeah, right, of course, but give me something. Trust me, this is a good tactic for Bronzers. Nothing too serious, but not nothing. Has there been a time when you’ve forgotten to scan absolutely everything in your basket at the self-checkout in the supermarket? Have you ever parked illegally? Maybe a bit of speeding on the motorway?” The trivial criminality of every suggestion was shrugged away as the man paced, hands lazily swatting away any concern Daniel may have about admitting to such minor indiscretions.  


“Something illegal but common?” said Daniel.


“Yeah, you know the type of thing, everyone’s done it, but nothing too serious.”


Daniel folded his arms and shifted on the hard ledge. “I mean… I might have slightly overestimated the value of some of my possessions when I insured the contents of my house.”


“Christ! Not that.” The man stopped and turned on his heel. “That’s a crime of dishonesty, insurance fraud, they’ll throw the book at you and it’ll undermine any evidence that you give. Bloody hell. I’ll pretend that I didn’t hear that.” The man patted all of his pockets in turn, chasing the ghost of absent cigarettes around his battered suit.


“It’s not that bad,” said Daniel. “The value of taxidermy squirrels fluctuates. You could argue that I’ve actually undervalued my collection.” 


“I will not be making that argument,” said the man, giving up his reflexive search for cigarettes that he knew he had been forbidden to bring into the cell.


“We could get an expert to value them.”


“A stuffed squirrel expert?” said the man, folding his arms and looking coldly at Daniel with glass eyes.


“Yes. They’re out there, there’s a whole collecting community. I’m a bit of an expert myself, actually. I don’t suppose we can use me though, can we?”


“We can’t use anyone, we’re not instructing experts on a Bronze fee. Look, shut up and give me something else to work with. We need a sacrifice; we need to have something ready that you would be plausibly apologising for.”


“Why? Why would I be apologising at all? I haven’t done anything wrong.”


“First of all, you have, everyone’s done something. Secondly, because we’re going to make an apology before anything else happens. Contrition now will go a long way later on. We need to get in there early and show that you’re remorseful. It could reduce any future sentence.”


“Sentence! But I haven’t been found guilty of anything. I don’t even know what the charge is. If I apologise now, it will look like I’m guilty of an unknown crime.”


“It might, but if the charge turns out to be something awful that you don’t want to cop to, we can say that the apology was made for the minor thing, not bloody insurance fraud, but something they can deal with quickly, give you a fine or a really short sentence.”


“Short sentence! There you go again.” Daniel was on his feet now. “I haven’t done anything wrong. Let’s just find out what the charge is and take it from there, shall we?”


“No,” said the man, looking Daniel up and down from his shoeless feet to the open neck of his untucked, crumpled shirt. “Get the apology in now. Look,” the man placed a hand on Daniel’s shoulder, “since the reforms the conviction rate has gone through the roof. Your chances of acquittal today are about 8%.” The man applied a smoothly increasing pressure and Daniel folded back down onto the hard ledge.


“What about innocent until proven guilty?” said Daniel with a shake of his head.


“Oh yeah, well, you still are, of course. It’s just that there’s a 92% chance that you will be found guilty and when you are there’s a 100% chance that you’ll be sentenced, and the sentencing guidelines say that they can take remorse and early acceptance of guilt into account. The earlier the better.”


“So, your legal advice is to just apologise for something I haven’t even done, without knowing what the alleged offence even is?”


“Yes. But with a sacrificial minor crime up our sleeve, just in case the charge turns out to be something really grim. Something bad enough to make it worth gambling when the odds are 1/11. Are you a gambler? Going for the Bronze package suggests that maybe you are, if you don’t mind me saying so.”


Daniel let his head fall back and looked up at the camera in the middle of the ceiling. “I can’t believe it, it’s…”


“Don’t say it,” said the man, a thick finger raised in paternal warning.  


“It’s Kafkaesque,” said Daniel staring into the shark’s eye.  


“Great, nice one, cheers for that,” said the man turning away and slapping both palms against the cell wall.


“What are you talking about?”


“The new reforms have made it clear that section 4 of the Public Order Act 1986 can be applied where the alleged victim is the state, or any emanation of the state, for example, a court, and the guidance lists the word Kafkaesque as an example of abusive or insulting language,” said the man to the wall, head hanging between his spread arms. “So, you’ve just committed the offence of intentionally causing harassment, alarm or distress.”  


“They’ve made it illegal to say that the court system is Kafkaesque?”


“Yes. And as an officer of the court, I have to report it.” To emphasise the point and make it clear that he had no choice in the matter, the man took one hand from the wall and pointed up at the black camera lens.  


“But earlier you said, I’ll pretend that I didn’t hear that, about the squirrel thing.”


“There’s no guidance about squirrel-based insurance fraud.” The man turned and slumped with his back against the wall.” He frowned and looked down into the corner of the room, searching an unseen text. “Yet.” He looked up at Daniel and smiled, showing a sliver of magnolia dentistry. “It’s a grey area. A grey squirrel area.”


“So, I’ve committed an offence by saying that something is Kafkaesque, even though it is Kafkaesque and my own lawyer has to report me for it?”


“You’ve now committed the offence four times and I have to fill in a separate form for each one, so please don’t say it again.”


“But that’s…”


“Yes, it is,” said the man stepping forward and clamping his hand over Daniel’s mouth. Daniel could taste salt on the hard palm and smell the acrid tang of the man’s nicotine habit on his worn grey cuff. “But we must uphold the rule of law,” he said, staring hard into Daniel’s eyes. “Can’t have people throwing the K word around.” A grin split his face into a delta of crow’s feet. “Or the public will lose faith.”


The two men stared at each other over the hairy ridge of the man’s hand. After a few long seconds the man took his hand from Daniel’s mouth and straightened, returning to his repetitive three-pace measuring of the small cell. 


“This is unbelievable,” said Daniel, watching the man’s bluebottle patrol. “How can that possibly be a crime?”


“Wait! That’s it,” said the man, stopping and stooping to clap his hands to Daniel’s upper arms, pulling him to his feet. “That’s your crime. I’ll make my report, then you make your apology and then when we get the charges we decide whether you were apologising for the crime we know about, your repeated use of the K word, or the mystery crime. If the mystery crime is something really grim then we tie the apology to the K word incidents and you can then decide if you want to do another apology for the big one, or take your 1/11 shot at acquittal.” His grin buckled under the weight of a sudden frown and he pushed Daniel back down onto the ledge. “Of course, in your case the odds will be much worse than that.”


“Why?” sighed Daniel, his tiredness complete, the word interrogating not just the matter of his worsening odds, but everything that had happened to him since he had looked up from his spam sandwich to see two unfamiliar men standing by his desk in the bank. Laura from HR had handed him his coat before he even stood up. He’d looked at her dumbly, crumbs on his tie. He wished he’s taken one more bite before they took the sandwich off him and put him in the van.  


“Well, all of the public order offences you’ve just committed will be taken into account.”


The man’s words brought Daniel back into the cell. “I don’t know what’s happening. I don’t know what to do,” he said, raising a hand to his chest, where his crumby tie had hung before they confiscated it, along with his shoes and belt and wallet and phone, all of the personal furniture of a normal day.


The man and the shark’s eye lens stared down at Daniel. “Just say you’re sorry. It’s your best bet.”


Daniel nodded and turned to the wall, lowering himself into a foetal coil on the hard ledge. “I’m sorry,” he said, before the cell door slammed shut and the light blinked out.  `

      description:`After uttering his last words, he closed his eyes and never opened them again. His mouth was still open, as if he had run out of energy halfway through closing it. He inhaled the tiniest bit of air, savored it one last time, and after letting it escape, he was gone


There lay my father. Or rather, there now lay his body - a vessel of flesh that had housed his immortal soul for the past eighty-seven years. What had been a strong and solid home at first had grown fragile with the passing years, until in the end it was nothing but a decaying uninhabitable shell.


It was the end of July, and we were baking in a 30-degree heatwave - I was at my father’s farmhouse in the village of Fiveoaks, Cambridgeshire where he had lived his entire life. Even with the curtains drawn the room was too warm, and I knew I had to move fast before the heat did too much damage to the fragile lifeless frame he had left behind. The undertaker would be waiting for my call, all arrangements had already been made.


Before reaching for the phone, I allowed myself to sit in silence just a moment longer. I had been keeping watch in the large armchair next to his bed for the last three days. I had barely slept waiting for the inevitable, determined to ensure he would not be alone in his final moment, perhaps even hoping to catch a glimpse when it came. Something to reassure me of what came next. I am not a young man myself and the thought of death made me nervous. 


I had seen nothing of the great beyond and instead was now paralysed by an oncoming wave of grief, as well as shock that came with my dying father’s last words: 


"I killed her. I killed Maureen Chapman.” 


***


In 1975 when I was sixteen years old Maureen Chapman disappeared. 


Through most of our early childhood she and I had gone to the same primary school. We were never particularly close but as children of similar age living in a small village we spent much time together, mostly as part of a larger group but sometimes on our own. When we were fourteen our schooling went in different directions - as the other local children I too went to the village Grammar while Maureen was sent to a fine private school some distance away. 


Her brother Michael, who was in the same year group as my little sister Sarah, followed Maureen’s footsteps; Sarah, who was born with mild Down Syndrome and struggled in regular school was accepted to a private special-ed school. Sarah died five years ago in a freak car accident; her life was long, healthy and fulfilling thanks to the school that gave her the support she needed early on in life.


Maureen and Michael had been raised by a single mother. Nancy moved to the village with two small children and no husband many years before her daughter’s disappearance. She made no secret of the fact that the children’s father was not actively involved in their lives and while normally this would have set tongues wagging, Nancy was so charming everyone here fell in love with her instantly. 


Nancy worked as a secretary at an investment firm based in Cambridge, had done so for many years. When Maureen was eleven and Michael nine, the founder of the firm Reginald Lawson died. A rather unremarkable event given his advanced years but when his will was read it transpired that Nancy had been his mistress for the best part of two decades, and that he was the father of both her children.  


In his will he claimed to have loved them all very much and to make up for his failures in life, he left them his entire fortune. The will also disinherited his lawful wife and grown son, both of whom Reginald had a falling out with years prior, and had not spoken to since. 


The two of them contested the will and it took Nancy and her children two years to finally receive their share of the estate by which time the entire county knew her name and face, as well as those of her children. Nancy remained dignified through the unpleasantness, and the village stood by her the entire time. The case was eventually settled, and Nancy emerged a wealthy woman, yet made very few changes to her old life except for sending the children to best private schools in the county. 


***


The last time anyone saw Maureen was Saturday at her boarding school. She had stayed behind for the weekend as her mother and brother had gone to London to see a play and she did not want to be bored on her own at Fiveoaks. Her roommate at school was also away and Maureen’s disappearance went unnoticed until the following morning. After receiving a call from school on Sunday, Nancy alerted the police. 


The grounds and nearby woodlands were searched thoroughly, the river and two small lakes dragged. Maureen’s schoolmates were questioned, especially those who were present over the weekend, as were locally known criminals, particularly those known for bothering young girls. There were police everywhere but no sign of Maureen. 


A week passed with no meaningful leads until a ransom letter arrived at Nancy’s house. It had been held up by a postal strike of all things! The letter demanded £100,000 in exchange for the girl; the date of the swap was to be the very same night. Nancy was distraught but also now more hopeful that her daughter was still alive. 


The letter instructed Nancy to drop the money in a bag behind a red postbox near the supermarket parking lot at 11pm - after the kidnapper has successfully retrieved it her daughter would be returned. She was to come alone. Nancy took on the task of dropping the money while two policemen set up near the back of the dark parking lot to catch the kidnapper in action and thus ensure the girl would be found. 


Nancy arrived at the drop-off alone as had been instructed. She dropped the money behind the postbox and left. After she had gone a car pulled into the parking lot, and the people in the car were immediately arrested – they were Jake Malone and Cindy Travers, two teenagers from the village on a rendezvous. The kids, looking rather sheepish, were let go after a short interrogation; when the police went to check on the money it was gone. The kidnapper had taken it in the middle of the chaos and left in the dark without anyone noticing a thing. 


Hours passed, and then days, but there was no sign of Maureen. Then a week went by, a month, and eventually a year. The ongoing active investigation which included several interviews with both Reginald’s scorned wife and disgruntled son, yielded no results, and eventually the case went cold. It was however never officially closed and every now and again, even decades later the police would follow up on new leads or take a fresh look at the old ones. 


It has now been more than forty years. Michael lives in Canada with his family, Nancy passed fifteen years ago from cancer, having never learned what happened to her daughter. She died hopeful that perhaps Maureen, having grown tired of the tabloid circus that surrounded her life, simply chose to disappear, and that whoever had demanded the ransom money was nothing more than an opportunist.


In the end she convinced herself that her daughter was out there somewhere, living in peace and perhaps married with a family of her own. In her final moments, dosed up on morphine, she hallucinated that Maureen was by her bedside, and died with a weak smile on her face. 


I however now knew the truth. 


***


"I took her from her room - the windows faced outside on the ground flood, and she was a slight girl, so it was not very difficult. I climbed in, and I waited until she came back from the bathroom which was in the hallway. I covered her mouth with tape so she couldn’t scream and then I dragged her outside. I was fast, she had no time to react and there was no mess in the room - you see, that’s why Nancy thought maybe Maureen ran away because it was so tidy in there. When we got in the car that was hidden behind the hedge, I dropped her on the back seat and drove away. I saw her face in the rearview mirror, she was so confused when she recognised me. She had known me most of her life, and she didn’t understand why I was doing what I was doing, the poor girl. I explained it, I kept telling her we needed the money - for Sarah. Sarah was doing so badly in that school - no one gave her the care she needed. She was such a bright girl, and she deserved so much more. We couldn’t afford that special-ed school, and we had the farm so we couldn’t have the scholarship either. We needed to help Sarah, and we needed money for that. I think she understood, you know. Maureen did. I swear, she understood, and she wanted to help. Maureen was such a good girl; she was so kind, and she was always so nice to Sarah. Michael too - he helped her with her homework, you know. I had prepared everything for Maureen in the disused stables, she had blankets, books, and I got her food every day. And then when I got the money and came back to let her go home, she was dead! I didn’t hurt her, I swear. She had been on the upper ledge, where the old stacks of firewood used to be. She had slipped down and couldn’t get up from there, and the ropes that I had used to tie her... well, she had strangled herself with them by accident. I swear it was an accident. I did not mean to kill her. I swear!” 


I stared at my father in disbelief as he came to the end of his deathbed confession. His speech was just whizzing now - he used up all his energy to tell me what happened, and I held my breath the entire time as if me using less air somehow allowed him to have more. 


“God forgive me. I killed her. I killed Maureen Chapman.” 


***


The week between his death and the funeral were harder than I had expected. I suppose that is normal but not only was I burying my father whom I had loved all my life, all sixty years of it, I was also coming to terms with the man I may have never really known.  


The evening after the funeral I sat on the front porch of his farmhouse, and for the first time since the confession, I allowed myself to have a truthful conversation with my conscience whom I had kept at bay until then.


Was it true what my father had said? Could he have hallucinated it all - like many people do when they are dying? Did he make it all up just for the hell of it?! That didn’t make sense. False death bed confessions were not unheard of either, especially with very old people. But if it was true, did he do it for the reasons he said he did? Was it for Sarah or was it for something else? Sure, Sarah did go to the special school in the end and none of us questioned how dad had made it happen. From then on Sarah’s life had run a beautiful course, better than anyone in her condition could have expected. Things are better now for people like her, but this was the 70s in rural England, she had little chance. But a chance is what my parents had given her. My parents... Did my mother know? And if so, how much? And did Maureen really die the way he had said, or did he kill her intentionally, maybe right after he kidnapped her? After all, she had seen his face, would he have risked letting her go after that? It made no sense. Or did he make that part up? But I couldn’t also see how my father, the gentle and kind soul I had known, did any of it. Maybe it is true - no one ever really knows the people they love. And where is Maureen now? Dad never got a chance to tell me what happened after she died. In the end I was left with more questions than answers.  


I debated with myself. He was gone now. My mother went long before him. Sarah was gone too. I never married nor had children so there was no one left to protect in my family. But Nancy was also gone. Only Michael was out there somewhere, living his life in Canada, far away from Fiveoaks and all the sadness this place would have meant for him. Yet even that far away he would no doubt be still wondering what happened to his big sister, and his heart would always be broken from the pain he had witnessed his mother endure. He was now the only living link to Maureen, other than me. We were the only two people left, and our lives would always be intertwined even if we had not seen each other, not even thought of each other for forty years. 


I stood up and looked down from the porch to the rose garden in front of it. It was in full bloom and the beautiful scent was overpowering in the warm summer evening. This was my father’s garden - he had almost obsessively tended to it since it was planted close to my 17 birthday. He loved it deeply and I didn’t need to dig it up to know this is where Maureen was buried. 


The next morning, I booked a flight to Toronto. `

      description:`My phone buzzed. I rolled over to look at the text my cousin Maya had just sent.


Can you send photo you took of all the girls in costume last night? xoxo


My head was throbbing. Hanging out with Maya was fun, but she was eight years younger than me and she and her friends loved to do shots. I needed to stick with beer only if I didn’t want the hangover.


That’s what I'd do next time.


I opened my photos app to find the picture Maya had requested. It was a group shot I had no memory of taking. It wasn’t everyone who’d been at the party - just the girls who’d dressed up, all five of them smiling cheesily. The starlet, the busybody, the social climber, the professor, and the old lady - everyone dressed to impress. The most incredible costume, by far, was worn by a girl named Lee who was a stranger to this group, the new girlfriend of Maya’s friend Patrick. She was a gorgeous girl in her twenties, but she’d come wearing make-up on her face that aged her fifty years.


The photo of the girls wasn’t great - there was a weird glare off of Maya’s microwave or something - but I sent it, and then began to scroll through the other recent photos. I had no memory of any of them.


It was a problem. I mean, I didn’t have a problem problem, and everyone had gotten a little sloppy last night. But Maya’s boyfriend Matthew had to get me an Uber - I was too drunk to drive home - and that was embarrassing.


There were photos of Maya and Matthew being adorable; a few selfies of me with others, which were mortifying, since my make-up had smeared without me knowing; and one photo of a dead body.


I deleted that one - it was blurry - and rolled over to go back to sleep.


*****


The idea of a murder mystery party had sounded corny to me at first, but Maya was great at selling the idea of a good time.


“It’ll be hilarious,” she promised me over drinks a few weeks ago. “I’ve got dibs on being Josephine La Rosa, the movie star, though, so you can’t take that one.”


I’d never been to a murder mystery party before, but Maya had explained the concept. Everyone was given a dramatic role to play, an entirely new identity for the evening. One of us would serve as the moderator, handing out index cards telling people different things they needed to say and do throughout the evening. There would be one card given to a character instructing them to pretend they’d been killed. The remainder of the evening would involve all the players trying to sort through the clues and solve the murder.


I didn’t want to participate. “I’m not really into role play,” I told Maya. She wiggled her eyebrows at me, making me laugh. “You know what I mean - dressing up, acting.”


“You have to do it,” she insisted. I got a vision of Maya as a high school student. She was skilled in the art of peer pressure.


Of course, we didn’t go to high school at the same time. When I was in high school, getting bullied by the popular girls and trying to keep my head down, Maya was in grade school. My other cousin - Maya’s older brother Stephen - was a year ahead of me in school. We were friends back then, but I didn’t see him much these days. He was married, with two kids who were the kind of adorable that made me ache. I didn’t like thinking about Stephen and his perfect family.


“I’ll come,” I promised Maya. “But I’m not dressing up.”


*****


Before the party, I’d made a rule for myself - no beer, only liquor. I had a tendency to pound beers but was better at slowly sipping a mixed drink.


A party like this was literally my worst nightmare. Every other girl was confident, impressive in their role. Maya was an effervescent Hollywood starlet. Her three closest girlfriends - Molly, Miranda, and Tess - had clearly gotten ready altogether, and their costumes were spectacular. They were a close-knit group, and it made me miss my closest girlfriends, who I didn’t see as much these days.

It was when Lee entered that I started to feel overwhelmed. There was a flurry of activity when she walked in with Patrick, the girls oohing and aahing at her costume and make-up, Maya’s buddy Aaron grabbing her cane and poking her with it flirtatiously.


“So nice to meet you all,” Lee had croaked in a faux old lady voice. Why were some girls so beautiful that they could twist their faces gruesomely and still grab the attention of every guy in the room?

Even Matthew stared at her, his mouth agape, when she entered. I elbowed him, which seemed to snap him out of it.


“She’s hot, but you have a girlfriend who’s my cousin,” I’d whispered to him.


Matthew had shaken his head, grinning back at me. We got along well. From our converations, I knew that he had also been an ugly duckling in high school. Maya had shown me his old yearbook, laughing affectionately at his bowtie and buck teeth. With a bit of dental work and a six figure job, he was now a catch and had the confidence that went with it.


That stung a little. Ugly ducklings can either grow into swans, or into sloppy ducks like me.


*****


The next time my phone buzzed, I was still in bed, even though it was nearly noon. It was Maya again. She always sprang right out of bed after a night of drinking. That was the difference between twenty-seven and thirty-five.


She was sobbing.


“Lee is dead,” she said, her voice quiet and trembling.


I laughed. Lee had been a fantastic murder victim the night before. Really, what was she not good at? Matthew had handed her the index card - he’d fixed his staring problem by then, just smiled briefly at her - and she’d disappeared into Maya’s bathroom to splay herself out on the tile floor. When we discovered her, she was covered in red, having stolen a bottle of ketchup from the refrigerator for added effect.


“No, no, Amy.”


I paused.


“Really dead,” Maya said. “Patrick just called from the hospital. She’s dead.”


*****


An hour later, the eight of us - all the murder mystery party attendees, except for Lee - were at the police station.


Maya was a wreck. I was trying not to throw up. I’d taken a shot of tequila before I left for the police station. Madness, maybe, but it was all I’d had in the house - my little effort at moderating, since tequila hurt my stomach. The other girls were crying. Aaron and Matthew were stone-faced.


We saw Patrick, down the hallway with an officer, too far away to see his face.


We weren’t supposed to speak to each other, and we were quickly separated. Maya looked at me longingly as a female police officer escorted her to a private room.


“Ma’am?”


I looked up.


“Can you come with me?”


The room looked just like the ones I’d seen on TV - a large window, a rectangular table, two empty wooden chairs. I stared at the officer. “Is this an investigation?”


He was older - maybe my father’s age, with graying hair and rosy cheeks. He nodded. “Precautionary, I’m sure,” he said. “I’m Officer Myers.”


“How did she die?” I asked.


Officer Myers narrowed his eyes at me. “No one told you?”


I shook my head. “Patrick didn’t tell Maya.”


“Ms. Latour, have you been drinking?”


I could feel my face turn red. “It’s been - it was a late night, and then the news -”


He was frowning at me, sternly - the way Dad used to. “Can you tell me anything about the end of the evening - the goodbyes?”


“Don’t you want to know about the murder?”


Officer Myers stared at me, and I flushed again. “Ms. Latour, no one has said anything about a murder, and you just told me you don’t know how Ms. Imogene Monroe -”


“Who?”


I regretted my question instantly. This officer didn’t like to be interrupted.


“Imogene Monroe is the woman who died right after attending a party you also attended, Ms. Latour.”


My mouth felt dry. “I didn’t know - she said her name was Lee. I never met her before last night.” Officer Myers continued to stare at me.


Everything was all wrong.


When I’m nervous, I drink. If I can’t drink, I babble incessantly.


“Did she - was it a car accident? She had a bit to drink, but not as much as Patrick.” I closed my eyes, picturing them at the door of Maya’s house. Patrick was slumped and sloppy, not that I’m one to talk, but Lee had seemed just fine. She had smiled at me and thanked me. Why had she thanked me? “I gave her a bottle of water, for the road,” I added, remembering.


It was the wrong thing to say. Officer Myers tried to keep his expression neutral, but his mustache twitched and I could hear his foot start to tap beneath the table.


“Ms. Latour,” he said quietly. “Do you have anyone you can call?”


*****


There wasn’t anyone to call. My mother had left me and Dad when I was a kid. A year ago, I could have called Dad, but he’d just been moved into an assisted living facility a few months ago after receiving his diagnosis. Early onset Alzheimer’s, just like my grandfather. Dad was in his fifties when we found out. Now, he was sixty-three, and he didn’t know who I was half the time when I went to visit. I didn’t visit him much, honestly. It was too hard to see him the way he was.


The only person I wanted to talk to was Maya, but Officer Myers explained that she was being questioned down the hall and us communicating wasn’t an option.


There was a phone in the room with us. There was only one person I could think of to call, and I really didn’t want to call him. I took my cell phone from my pocket.


“I can’t let you look through your phone,” Officer Myers said sternly.


“I just need to look up a number,” I said. “My cousin Stephen.” He watched me carefully. When I unlocked the phone, it was the photo of Maya, Lee, and the other three girls that popped up first. I quickly clicked away from it and found Stephen’s number, then dialed it on the station phone.


“Amy? Are you okay?”


My eyes filled wih tears. My last interaction with Stephen had been awful. Yelling. Accusations. I wasn’t a good daughter. His father was taking care of Dad the way I should be doing. I don’t know what I expected today, but his voice was concerned and caring.


“I don’t know. I need a lawyer. I think I’m in trouble.”


“You are. Don’t react - I’m sure you’re not alone.”


My eyes shifted to Officer Myers.


“Maya already called me. I don’t think they’ve figured that out yet, so keep cool, okay?” Stephen was a surgeon, and as he spoke I could picture him in the OR - giving instructions confidently, in his element, knowing what to say and do in ways I never did.


It wasn’t always like this. In high school, Stephen was a jock who partied and I was bookish and intelligent. I had a nearly photographic memory, a straight A average, and multiple college scholarship offers. I didn’t even drink until college. Then after college, when Dad started looking right through me when we talked, I started having a beer with dinner every night to take the edge off. One a day led to two, then six, and then a decade passed and Stephen was a hot shot and I was barely able to remember what happened at a freaking murder mystery party that I wouldn’t have attended if I was a normal thirty-five-year-old with a steady job and a family and a moderate amount of self-esteem.


“Amy? Amy!”


“I’m here,” I said quickly. “Can you find the number for the attorney?”


“Good girl. Listen, it’s the waters.”


Was he speaking in code? “Stephen?”


“The waters you gave out as Lee and the others were leaving,” Stephen said. “She had a peanut allergy, and there were traces of peanut in the bottle she drank out of. She didn’t open it until she stopped driving. Patrick woke up in the passenger seat and she was going into anaphylactic shock. No epipen in her purse, either, and Patrick swore that she always had one on her.”


My head was spinning. “So now -”


“My wife’s dad is an attorney - he’s retired, but he’ll have someone down there in twenty minutes, Ames.” He hadn’t called me that in such a long time. “Ames? They don’t have any motive, okay? They’ll release you. Just hang tight.”


I nodded.


“Ames?”


“Yeah - yes. Stephen, you didn’t ask me -”


“I don’t need to ask you anything. You didn’t do this. Stay cool and we’ll be right there.”


*****


The only person who’d ever accused me of having a drinking problem was Stephen, and I denied it. I was a crappy daughter and a lousy cousin and friend, and I liked to party, but I wasn’t an alcoholic. Yeah, I drank when I was sad, and yeah, sometimes things got messy, but I was functional. I had a job, and I paid my bills, and I’d never gotten a DUI or passed out in a ditch or anything like that.


Yet as I sat there, waiting for my cousin to save me from the mess I’d created, I couldn’t deny that drinking had contributed to my predicament. I’d been a hungover mess all day, and not thinking straight.


I used to be the girl with the level head, the girl who could think through any problem, the girl who did logic puzzles for fun. I’d been solving the Hidden Pictures puzzles from Highlights magazine ever since I was four years old -


It hit me suddenly. My head had been throbbing all day, but I forced myself to concentrate.


There was something I’d seen. Or was it something someone had said? Or both?


There was a knock at the door. An officer entered - the one I’d seen with Maya earlier - with a woman I’d never seen before.


“Ms. Latour, come with me.”


I rose, but I didn’t leave the room. Officer Myers had stepped in my path. “What the -”


“Amber Griffin, Ms. Latour’s attorney. You don’t have the evidence to hold her, sir.”


They started to bicker, the officers and my attorney, and I bent forward, tucking my head between my legs and placing my hands over my ears to muffle the noise.


*****


It was Miranda who murdered Lee - or rather, the professor who fake murdered the old lady, which we found out toward the end of our murder mystery party evening. Everyone dissolved in laughter when it was revealed, mostly because Miranda is such a sweetheart.


Matthew was the one who solved it. He wasn’t drinking at all, which I think helped. He’d had one mixed drink while he, Maya, and I were prepping for the party, but nothing after the other guests had all arrived.


“It’s because she was cruel to me in high school,” I remembered Miranda saying, giggling, almost apologizing to Lee for the affront. “Lee’s character. That was in our back stories. She used to bully me every day, so when I saw her as a grown-up, I snapped.”


By this point in the night, I was incredibly drunk, but those words stood out to me. To Matthew, too, I could tell. We knew what it was like to be bullied. The stories Matthew had told me over the past three years - the ways he’d been tormented.


It was enough to push anyone over the edge.


*****


There was something that was eluding me. A memory. A visual.


If I can figure this out, I thought, I’ll never drink again.


It wasn’t just about my freedom, which I could tell was in jeopardy. Of course, I was terrified. I hadn’t done anything to hurt anyone, and I wanted desperately to go home.


More than that, though, I wanted to conquer my memory, my brain. I wanted my mind to be my own again. How many times had I lost my thoughts, my memories, been unable to retrieve something from the corners of my mind?


When everything clicked into place, I lifted my head and looked at Officer Myers and my attorney, who stopped arguing and looked back.


“Did you have something to share, Ms. Latour?” Amber said quietly.


It was the reflection I’d seen in the photo I sent Maya that morning - a distraction from the five girls in the photograph. The combination of microwave and oven and a trick of the light, I supposed, because what I remembered right then was what I’d seen that morning but not registered as important in my half-drunk, half-hungover state.


A vision of Matthew, an open water bottle in one hand, his other fist closed tightly around something.


It wasn’t proof. I had no idea if they’d even believe me. I was still in a lot of trouble.


Yet I felt satisfied, the way anyone would feel when they find something - their keys, a fact, a memory - that they’d thought was lost forever.


“There’s a photo on my phone,” I said quietly. “Passcode 5560, my dad’s birthday. You need to see it.” `
