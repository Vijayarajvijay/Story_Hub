The case details were read aloud, and a weak, muffled voice began to speak.


"Dear people of X. Once again, we gathered for an important case. The defendant, 698278, who was recently apprehended, has been found guilty of spreading countless lies against our Holy Leader and his esteemed colleagues since the Dark Years. As you know, lying, and undermining state unity are among the greatest sins condemned by God, especially when targeting a great leader. However, I want to remind you once again, that God has blessed us with the most merciful leader, who has granted everyone the right to seek forgiveness. Now, we shall begin the Purification Court of the defendant, 698278. Defendant, are you ready to admit your quilt and apologize?"


This was the first time I’d been addressed since entering the freezing courtroom. As the thick black blindfold was lifted, I tried to grasp what was happening, but when it was finally removed, I thought I'd gone blind. I was still swallowed by an endless darkness.


It must have been the drugs, I thought, or the endless interrogations I’d endured over the past weeks. But it was probably neither, because moments later, my vision slowly began to return, and shapes started to form.


I froze.


What is that? I thought. There was a giant man in front of me.


Was that real? Had the drugs finally driven me mad, I wondered? Could be; I knew they’d done it before. But after a few seconds, I realized that wasn’t the case—at least, not for me. As my eyes fully adjusted, the world around me came into sharp focus.


The 'giant man' was actually a strange podium, rising with hundreds, maybe thousands, of people. It resembled the lecture halls I’d seen when education still held value, but instead of sloping backward, the levels were stacked vertically, forming a towering structure of men in suits.


So this was the courtroom I’d heard about so many times. I was standing within a wooden frame, flanked by two men in white uniforms with concealed faces. A web of cables was attached to my body, and in front of me, a strange, deep emptiness stretched out.


"Respond to the judge!"


A sharp pain throbbed in my head. The judge, I thought. Which one was he? And what was I supposed to say? It wasn’t easy to pick out one thought from the billions swirling in my mind for years. As I scanned the faces in front of me, all with the same unreadable expression, one man at the top of the giant shape caught my attention.


His gaze seemed fixed on something behind me, evident from the slight tilt of his head. My eyesight, dulled from years of hiding, couldn’t make out his face, but I sensed something unsettling about him.


I turned and glanced at the wall. Of course, I thought. A giant poster of the president.


It was the one president had made ten years ago when he took charge after covering up all his crimes, promising to "bring democracy to the country." He'd ordered it to be displayed everywhere, and anyone who didn’t show proper respect for it was arrested and imprisoned.


The Purification Courts were the final step, and I knew many had ended up there. TV channels claimed that 'confused' individuals were 'purified' and reintegrated into society, but no one really knew the truth. The president silenced anyone who spoke out against him, and with all opposing views suppressed, the news became meaningless. As one of the few who had tried to speak the truth in a society of parrots, I understood this better than anyone.


I didn’t bow my head. I wasn’t here for that. I’d already made my decision years ago, and I could predict the outcome. This was probably my last chance to speak, and I was going to use it to shout the truth.


When I turned, I knew exactly who I was facing.


"Lower your head, defendant! Know your place!" the judge commanded.


Where is this man? I thought. Then I saw him: a small man with a microphone, wearing a faded and torn judge's robe, barely recognizable. He was sitting at the very bottom of the podium, right at the foot of the giant man. I wasn’t surprised.


“The recordings and witnesses show you committed severe crimes to undermine the state's integrity, continuing until your capture. We will review your actions, and you will have the chance to defend yourself. As everyone knows, freedom of thought and the right to defend oneself are cherished rights in our country, upheld by our Holy Leader.”


Freedom of thought, huh? I thought, suppressing a laugh. But when I glanced at the crowd sitting to my left, labeled ‘Audience,’ something stopped me. It was my mother.


When the president began imprisoning journalists and opposition members, I had to hide. At first, my mother visited, but eventually, the visits stopped. I never asked why, and after I moved, we never saw each other again. Twelve years, I thought. It had been twelve years since I last saw her. I spent those years believing justice would prevail and that one day, I'd reunite with my mother and loved ones. But after all this time, this was where we met: the Purification Courts.


Don’t worry, Mom, I wanted to say. Everything will be fine. But I couldn’t make a promise I knew I couldn’t keep.


Do not let it distract you, I told myself, thinking through my plan. Then I repeated the phrase that had sustained me for weeks, months, and years: “You can never know when and where a single piece of truth can destroy a whole lie.”


As I stared at my mom, she slowly turned her head. Considering my condition, it must have been difficult for her to look at me, I thought. Still, I was feeling a strange unease settle in my chest.


“Our Holy Leader has given everyone the right to be reborn and cleanse themselves of their sins," the judge continued. "What you need to do is admit your crimes, repent, and sincerely apologize."


Sincerely... I knew what that meant.


"Do you know what the wires connected to your body are?"


I swallowed. I'd heard many things about the Purification Courts. It was the president's greatest weapon, labeling those with moral values as "sinners in need of purification," all while reinforcing his image as a merciful leader. You would be forgiven if you apologized sincerely, but punished if you failed to do so. The punishment was clear, though no TV channel openly discussed it. Still, a few people, risking their lives, managed to bring the truth to light.


A high-tech lie detector, right beneath the giant man, was the vital organ of this court. One day, the president celebrated the invention of this machine on television, with a team of 50 engineers who had created it. Just one week after the celebration, the whole engineering team died in a tragic fire.


What I couldn’t understand was how, with hundreds of spectators at every trial, no one spoke out. This meant no one was protesting these decisions. There must have been protests, I thought. And he must have covered them up, too. Could people really stay silent while their neighbors and families were being eliminated? But if the public had reacted, would we have reached this point? I silenced the voice inside me.

All they needed was to hear the truth one more time.


I was about to speak, but the judge continued, “The wires will show if you're lying or truthful. The one around your neck will punish you if you persist in your sins.”


I traced my hand over the thick cord around my neck. The deep void in front of me now made sense. Medieval, I thought. I wasn’t surprised. I was waiting to hear something about the wires on my temples, but the explanations stopped.  


“Do you understand everything, 698278?'"


The judge spoke so calmly, it was as if he were reciting cheap lines from a cheap play. He didn’t waste any time and looked at the pile of papers in front of him.


"Crime One: You worked for a newspaper, which was later purified and renamed 'Only the Truth.' You wrote defamatory articles accusing Our Holy Leader of various crimes. All of your former colleagues testified that you made these false accusations and wrote baseless articles. Do you admit your sins?"


As I listened, I remembered a warning my friend had given me while we were writing down the president’s crimes on small papers to spread to the people: "We’re doing this today, but if you ever get caught, don’t protest. No truth is more important than your life. Especially in this country, for these people." He had been caught two years ago. I wondered what he had said in court. Had he lied?


I won’t do that, I said, looking at the president fidgeting at the top. Even if I couldn't topple this giant, I wouldn’t be one to support it. I took a deep breath, looked at my mother and said,


"No. I do not accept any of the charges you’ve made. I only wrote the truth." My words caused a strange hum to rise in the courtroom.


"Pardon?" the judge said, raising an eyebrow.


"Are you saying you still believe our Supreme Leader is..." He tilted his head back as if it might snap, then brought his hands together, as if to apologize for what he was about to say, "...a thief and a liar?"


"I’m not saying I believe that," I said. "It is the truth!"


"If there is no evidence, then there is no truth to speak of," the judge said, his eyes narrowing as he stared me down.


"Yes, right now there’s no evidence because you destroyed it all. All the evidence you destroyed clearly showed how much of a thief the president is!" I turned to the audience. "You witnessed everything, too! Please, open your eyes—"


A sharp pain suddenly shot through my head, making me lose every word I had in my head.


I hadn’t expected this. It felt like a sword driving through the center of my brain, shredding everything inside. When I opened my eyes in pain, I saw something in the president’s hand, extending toward me. It looked like a remote control. With a grim face, he whispered something to those around him, and the whispers spread downward, the last reaching the judge.


"Very well. The interrogation is over," the judge said. "Since you persist in your slanders, you’ve lost your right to free speech. We’ll move directly to the purification session. Your mind is filled with poison and lies, so we’ll now tell you the truth. This is the last grace Our Holy Leader has granted to you."


I was still writhing in pain. I looked at my mother. She was listening to the judge, her hands folded over her chest.


"After each piece of information, I will give you a chance to speak, and you will apologize. Don’t try to say anything else. You won’t be able to, even if you want to," the judge added. As he finished speaking, the courtroom was bathed in bright red light. I tried to shield my eyes with my hand but couldn’t stop staring at my mother. How could she look so calm?


“When you claimed Our Holy Leader is a thief, you cited his golden palace and vast wealth, accusing him of stealing from the people. The truth is: The possessions of a nation’s leader reflect the reputation of the state. Our Supreme Leader has made these expenditures for the good of the people, not for himself. Moreover, a real citizen should even be willing to go hungry for the sake of their country."


The judge spoke so quickly that it made me anxious as I waited for a chance to speak. Finally, when he paused, I was about to respond, but instead, he continued. " When you claimed…” I was stunned. He was repeating the same words over and over. After the tenth repetition, he turned to me. "Do you admit your mistake and apologize?"


“Now!” I told myself, taking a deep breath and bracing for the pain, I opened my mouth.


"I'm sorry."

I paused, not believing my ears, then repeated,


"I'm sorry."


I covered my mouth with my hands. What was happening? No matter what I said, all that echoed in the courtroom were these two words. A terrible fear gripped me as the judge's words made sense: “Don’t try to say anything else. You won’t be able to, even if you want to.” As I touched the wires on my head, I saw the lie detector flashing harsh red lights.


"It’s not accepted," the judge said. "You are not sincere." Then, he began reading again.


"You claim the president violated and changed the constitution. However, the truth is: The president has amended and improved the outdated and flawed constitution for the benefit of the people, which makes it a blessing for us, not a crime."


After the tenth repetition, he asked again.

I didn’t know what to do. I wanted to scream at the audience, at my mother, “I’m not apologizing! You know I’ve done nothing wrong! Why are you looking at me like that, mom?”


But instead, a series of apologies kept pouring out of my mouth.

All my hopes of using this court as my last chance to speak the truth were shattered because I couldn’t control the words coming out of my mouth anymore. So, when the judge asked for the third time, I opened my mouth and said, “God damn you.”


The words I heard no longer surprised me.


After each of my responses, the room would fill with a blinding red light and a disturbing sound. It felt like this sound was only bothering me, as the audience watched with relaxed faces. I tried not to look at my mother’s side anymore; a voice inside me told me that if I did, I’d break down.


The same cycle repeated: the judge listed the crimes the president had committed and I had reported before, explaining how they were not crimes and highlighting the greatness and innocence of the president. After each one, he would turn to me, asking me to apologize. And with each time, the red light flashed, and he moved on to the next item.


"Your apology will not be accepted unless it is sincere," the judge repeated.


As I stood there, I struggled to understand the point of this absurd interrogation. They knew I had always chased the truth, as a journalist, no matter what. They knew I hadn't changed my mind, which was why I was here. So, what was the purpose of these pointless explanations and demands for an apology, knowing it wouldn’t change anything?


Without waiting my turn, “End this nonsense", I said.


The judge laughed: "Don’t bother trying to say anything else. Whatever you say, you will only be able to apologize. I told you."


A light flickered in my mind and I looked at the audience.


They knew, I thought. They knew they were controlling my voice. My eyes scanned them quickly. None of them wore wires.


As the judge spoke, I kept watching them and noticed something I hadn’t before. After each sentence, they nodded in perfect harmony, with the same confident demeanor—my mom included.


"Our Holy Leader has never had journalists or opposition figures executed. They are sinners sent by the devil." Up and down. "Our Holy Leader has never filled government positions with relatives. Each person earned their position through intelligence." Up and down. "Our Holy Leader has never silenced free speech. The shut-down channels and newspapers were spreading fake news." Up and down.


Again and again.


This wasn’t for me, I thought.

This interrogation, this “purification,” was never meant for me. It had never been. I lifted my head and looked at the little man at the top, and another truth became clear. It wasn’t you either. This wasn’t your creation. Not yours alone. Why had it taken me so long to see that?


The questioning continued at its relentless pace. I wanted to laugh, but only tears fell from my eyes. The lie detector, the rows of men before me, the deep void—none of it mattered anymore. I kept staring at the audience, at my mom. I was feeling something break inside me. As if someone had ripped away something I had hidden and nurtured inside me for years, leaving me alone with a vast emptiness.


They nodded after every word, their faces now holding a strange expression. Not pity, not hatred. It was more like, “You deserve this. Let’s see what happens now.”


“Defendant 698278. Do you admit your crime and apologize?”


Defendant 698278, I repeated.  698,278 times this court had convened, 698,278 people judged, 698,278 praises for the president’s mercy, and... 698,278 nods.


Up and down.


Then I started laughing, uncontrollably, hoping it would fill the emptiness inside me.




“You’re not sorry, are you?” the judge said with anger, after finishing all his lines.


“No,” I replied. Actually, “I’m so sorry.”


I prepared myself for one final step. There was only one thing left to do. For myself. For what I believed.


Forgive me, God, I said. "I am so sorry." And, I closed my eyes.


However just as I lifted my foot to take a step, a sound filled the entire hall.


It was applause.


I was taken aback and opened my eyes. Everyone was standing and clapping, and the entire courtroom was bathed in green.


Idiots, I said as I laughed harder. Bunch of idiots.`

    description:`With the mission running long and no exfil in sight, there’s little for Valerian and Roman to do besides purchase too many groceries, hole up in the safehouse, and settle old bets.

Val stands over the cracked electric stove, carefully stirring a pot of ukha. The delicate scent of herbs, spices, and freshwater fish spirals off the surface of the broth. It smells of home, and Val knows without looking that Roman is sprawled on the couch behind him.

“Just be careful not to let the salmon overcook,” Roman calls out. What would be genuine advice from anyone else, Val knows is actually a gentle rib.

He scoffs, though he doesn’t take his eyes off the pot. “I’ll win this time. You’ll see.”

“Sure,” Roman says generously. “Except you’re still missing something.”

Val inhales, letting the well-rounded scent settle around him. “You can bullshit about your ‘secret ingredient’ all you like—I know when you’re bluffing.”

Roman is grinning; Val can hear it in his tone. “Your gambling money in my pocket says otherwise. Fish about done?”

Delicately poking at one cube of salmon, Val is pleased to find it flaky, tender, and cooked all the way through. “Yeah. Come get it while it’s hot.”

He nudges the pot off the heat and dishes out two bowls. Roman plucks one from his hands and takes a preliminary sip.

“Hmm. You’re definitely close. But not quite. Still missing that all-important piece to bring it together.”

Val eats a spoonful as well, deflating as he realizes the truth. Roman is right. It’s good soup—but not as good as Roman’s. The flavors that had seemed so balanced in theory are lacking something crucial. His head dips with weary resignation. “Fine...you win. What’s the secret?”

“Not sure I should be telling just anyone,” Roman says in his loftiest tone. “How about this: a secret for a secret. You answer my question, and I’ll tell you what you’re missing.”

Val laughs and shakes his head, grinning down at his imperfect soup. “Fine, fine. Ask away.”

He turns to face Roman, and the dream becomes a nightmare.

The safehouse is broken and charred. Darkness seeps from the corners, a viscous black liquid that gathers higher and higher on the floor. And Roman—

Roman is in uniform, drenched in blood. Valerian knows it isn’t his own. Those bright eyes bore into Valerian’s, feverish, and when Roman speaks, more darkness oozes from between his teeth.

“Why didn’t you stop me, Val?”

Val jolts awake, nearly falling from his bunk as he flails against his sheets. His eyes take in details with trained expedience—rough white walls, a footlocker, a window looking out over the grey tinge of pre-morning light.

Val’s head falls against the pillow with a groan. He knows he won’t be getting back to sleep.

* * *
“Valerian.”

Val sights down his scope, not bothering to hide his scowl. “I’m busy.”

“It’s about Roman.”

Val feels his muscles tense, though the reticle over his target doesn’t so much as twitch. “What do I have to say to make you understand? I don’t need leave, I don’t need another psych eval, and I sure as hell don’t need your pity. Bastard got what was coming to him.”

Behind him, Lena crosses her arms. Val can’t see her, but he knows the sound.

“Lie to yourself all you like, but don’t you dare start lying to me.”

Valerian takes his eye off the scope to turn his head, looking up and over his shoulder at where Lena stands. Arms crossed, hips canted, exactly as he’d pictured her. “Did you come out just to bother me, or are you going to do anything useful to the Front?” he snaps. 

Lena rolls her eyes and takes out a scouter. “Wind from 31 degrees northeast. Target at 1572.8 meters out.”

Val presses his eye back to the scope of the long, lean Sovereign rifle, breathing out the frustration lingering in his muscles. The reticle settles perfectly in place, and the trigger pulls smooth as silk.

The air splits with the thunder of the Sovereign’s discharge, and Val feels the weapon kick hard against his shoulder. He doesn’t bother to check whether the shot landed as he sits up and glances back at Lena.

Her scouter is still held over her eyes, though she lowers it as Val turns toward her. “You always were the best,” she says with a touch of wryness. “Now, would you please listen?”

Val scoffs and slings the Sovereign over his shoulder. He gets to his feet, dusting some of the dirt and grit from the front of his uniform. “It’s cute when you imply I have a choice.”

Their boots crunch over rain-parched earth as they start the trek back to base. Valerian shields his eyes against the bloody sunset, content to let his brisk pace speak to his disinterest in what Lena has to say. Still, he doesn’t try to stop her when she brings up Roman again.

“The brass finally made their ruling,” she starts. Her voice is shaped cautiously, neither accusing nor exonerating. “The cave-in was officially labeled an accident. You’re off the hook, not that there ever was much doubt. Honestly, after everything Roman did, I’m a little surprised they never offered you a medal.”

Val’s pace doesn’t falter, but he can tell Lena sees the tension in his shoulders when she softens her voice.

“I don’t want to dredge it all up again; believe me, I don’t. But I thought you should know, there have been...troubling reports, from Old England. Someone who looks like him. Out in the forests.”

This time Valerian does pause. He whips around to search Lena’s face, even though he knows she’d never lie to him (or at least, never lie about Roman). “What are you saying? That he survived? I dropped fifty tons of rock on him, Lena.”

Lena spreads her hands in a gesture devoid of certainty. “They’re not substantiated claims. Just rumors. But you and I both know how potent his genmod was. A healing factor like that...”

The blistering heat of the desert fades from Val’s perception. For just a moment, he’s back in the chill of Old England’s forests, the thunder of falling stone still ringing in his ears. He’d cried, after. Sobbed like a baby, for the man Roman was and the thing he became and all the senseless loss of life he’d caused. Long after the tears ran dry, Val had stayed by the cave, too numb to leave and too scared to sift through the debris.

He feels the exact same, now. Terrified to dig further, not even knowing which alternative he’s scared of.

Eventually, he turns back towards base. He needs, suddenly and unequivocally, to sleep. A long, quiet nap curled up in his bunk sounds like exactly the thing.

“Will you go?” Lena calls after him. “Back to Old England?”

Val shakes his head without looking back. “They’d never assign me there.”

“Didn’t stop you the first time, as I recall.”

Val pretends not to hear her.

* * *
He dreams about Roman again, of course. It’s always been Roman.

Before the disastrous Operation: Crimson Thread, it was Roman’s laugh, his crooked smile, his dancing eyes. That unshakeable confidence. Arrogance, some would say. Roman’s genmod, the genetic alteration that allowed him to heal so rapidly and cleanly, was a powerful one, and he treated it like immortality. His attitude was infectious, intoxicating. Everything about the man lit Val like a fuse.

After Crimson Thread, Roman changed. His fire became feverish, secretive. He smiled less, isolated more, trained harder. He pushed his friends away. He pushed Val away.

Val fooled himself into thinking it was a temporary change, a grief response. Maybe Lena did, too. No one could have truly anticipated what Roman became.

There’s a new age dawning, Val. Can you hear the cries?

Val couldn’t. Not back then. But every night since, he’s heard them: the wails of friends, family, innocents—every life cut short by Roman’s hands, until the chorus of the damned numbers hundreds strong, every last one of them screaming inside Val’s head.

Why didn’t you stop him, Val?

* * *
Old England is cold, damp, and crawling with hostile mutations. Some are intelligent enough to form loose bands or packs; others eat each other on sight. Valerian hates the whole island with a passion.

He starts his investigation at the Lodge—one of the few bastions of sanity on this rock. It’s large as frontier settlements go, with a population somewhere in the triple digits. It also happens to host a small base for the Front, but the other Frontsmen turn out to be of little help. None of them have seen this supposed specter of Roman.

“If we did, we’d put him back in the ground, eh?” The Captain smirks. “Wish I’d been there to kill the bastard myself, but apparently some off-duty sergeant got the honors. Happened here, you know, just 20 klicks to the west.”

Valerian knows.

“Look, kid, I’ll level with you,” another officer tells him. “The locals like to report a sighting now and then, just to keep the Front’s interest. This place wouldn’t last a week without our patrols.”

“Roman Tovhana?” This soldier just shakes his head with a grin. “You’re about four months too late, my friend. Better luck next time.”

The townspeople are hardly more forthcoming. Most of them scowl and spit at Roman’s name. Some of them recall hearing a rumor about the man haunting the site of his death, but no one can remember who reported such a thing.

Val was hoping it wouldn’t come to this. But like the genmod that keeps his hands rock-steady on his weapons, he isn’t easily shaken. With a pack of supplies, his sidearm, and plenty of ammo, he heads out west towards the last place he saw Roman alive.

It takes him almost three days of unrelenting rain to find the cave again. When he does, it’s because he nearly trips over the entryway.

Loose stone shifts and skitters beneath his boots as he stumbles back. Squinting through the downpour, he can just make out the shadowy mouth of the cave behind its shroud of overgrown vegetation.

He approaches cautiously, taking in details. Trampled grass and underbrush. Small, muddy puddles about the right shape for bootprints. Someone’s been here, and recently. Maybe several someones.

That’s when he hears it, a muted echo of a voice he never thought he’d hear again.

“No! No, please, just let me go—”

Val’s lungs lock down. Like getting the wind knocked out of him in training, he can’t seem to find his breath.

Roman.

But Roman has never sounded like this. He never begged, not even staring down the barrel of a gun.

((Knew you’d be the one to find me.))

Val takes a step forward. Another. He stumbles down the uneven, natural steps of the cave, reeling as the smell of damp earth and rotting leaves brings back the memory, as clear as the rain on his skin.

((Roman’s smile. His easy posture. Val could almost convince himself, could almost believe this was his Roman, risen from the depths of madness.))

He falls against the slick stone wall of the cave, drinking deep gulps of air. He has rain in his eyes.

((But Roman’s eyes...his eyes were alight, gleaming in the beam of Val’s flashlight. Feverish.))

A new voice echoes from floor to ceiling. Laughing. “Still haven’t figured it out, have you?”

“No, wait—PLEASE!”

Roman’s scream shakes Val back to reality. That he recognizes, from a hundred reckless missions. From a terrible, thunderous rockslide.

Val’s steps quicken as he scrambles over fallen stone. Someone, he registers distantly, must have shifted enough of the wreckage to make a path.

He plunges deeper into the cave, Roman’s scream still lingering in his ears like the cutting edge of a knife. Finally, Val sees the flicker of light up ahead.

Nothing, not a single one of his fears (hopes?) prepares him for what he finds.

Roman Tovhana is alive. There’s no mistaking that proud nose, those dark eyes, the scar through his upper lip. And there’s certainly no mistaking the desperate, thrashing motions of something clawing for safety, for life.

Two strangers, a man and a woman, hold him down on his back. The man sits astride him, pinning his legs. In one hand he bears a bloody knife. Roman's clothes—long ago, a uniform—are weathered and torn, displaying the fresh, oozing wound down his chest and stomach.

“That one’s for my sister,” the man with the knife says. “This one’s for my wife—”

Valerian’s sidearm is in his hands before he’s fully pieced things together. As Roman screams again, Val levels the gun.

“Put the knife down.”

Three pairs of eyes snap towards him.

“And who the hell are you?” the woman barks.

Val’s never been so glad for his genmod, never been so fervently thankful that his gun remains steady, regardless of the storm lashing against his insides. “I’m with the Adamant Front. Care to explain what the hell you’re doing here?”

With Val serving as a distraction, Roman thrashes again, almost slipping free before the man with the knife snarls and jams the blade into Roman’s gut.

For once in his life, Val doesn’t hesitate.

The shot rings out over and over, echoing down the tunnel with the force of a cannon blast. The man formerly holding the knife howls in pain as the blade and two of his fingers spin away into darkness.

“Next one goes between your eyes,” Val hisses. “Get up. Both of you. Walk away, and never come back.”

“You bastard,” the nameless man gasps. He’s clutching the bloody remains of his right hand, trembling. “You crazy son of a— Don’t you know who this is?”

“I gave you a fucking order.” His voice doesn’t waver, even with doubt screaming in his ear like a hundred damned souls—

He doesn’t know if he’s prepared to kill these people. He doesn’t know if he could bring himself to cross that line—especially with the scenes of Roman’s murders so vivid in his mind.

Fortunately, his resolve isn’t put to the test. The man and the woman scramble upright and flee, hurrying past Val towards the mouth of the cave. Their footsteps have barely begun to fade when Val holsters his side arm and crouches down at Roman’s side.

This close, he can see the man’s a wreck. Hazy brown eyes squint up at him from a face sunken with hunger and creased from sleepless nights. His body is all angles, his torn clothing now drenched in blood.

“Hey,” Val says, and his voice comes out softer than he intends. “I need you to stay with me. There’s— I have so many questions.”

Roman’s eyes focus slowly, still narrow with pain and confusion. But clear. Lucid.

“Wh-who...who are you?”

* * *
“Here. Eat it while it’s hot.”

Val slides a bowl of ukha across the table, then settles in the other chair with his own. The delicate, complex aroma reminds him of home.

The man once named Roman Tovhana picks up his spoon and digs in. His eagerness to eat anything he doesn’t have to hunt and kill himself hasn’t waned, despite the month he’s spent in the safety of this rickety apartment.

He calls himself Rowan now, after the badly dented name he’d found on the dog tags he woke up with. It’s taken some getting used to, but Val rarely slips up. Rowan is very different from the man he once knew.

Instead of the military buzz of his predecessor, Rowan’s dark hair is long enough to flop in his eyes. He has dozens of new scars, most of which are twisted, knotted things or else deep gouges that never completely filled back in. And, of course, he no longer wears a uniform.

Neither does Valerian. The brass hadn’t known what to do with either of them, and so Val found himself quietly shuffled out of the fold. He misses it, some days—the hard work, the adrenaline, the camaraderie. But he doesn’t linger on the things he’s lost, not when the pieces he does have need so much work. Lena has been after him to try an old world remedy called therapy, which, from what Val can gather, involves a lot of talking and a lot of patience. Well, at least he’s good at one of those.

“This is amazing.” Rowan’s quiet voice breaks through Val’s reverie.

He looks up to see Rowan smiling—no longer a rare sight, but still just as valuable. Valerian smiles back and eats another spoonful. “It’s called ukha. I’m glad you like it. Took me years to get the recipe right, and it was never as good as Roman’s.” His smile fades. “I suppose I’m still missing something.”

Rowan considers for a moment. He takes a slow, exploratory sip. “...Huh. Have you tried a splash of—what’s the stuff called, from Lena—”

“Vodka?” A tiny thrill runs through Val’s stomach as he considers. “Hold on.”

He returns with a half-full bottle. A dash for his bowl, and one for Rowan’s. Val finds himself oddly nervous as he stirs the broth and raises a spoonful to his lips.

The vodka does complement well. It’s exactly what Val’s recipe was lacking—yet it still tastes nothing like Roman’s.

“I think it’s perfect,” Rowan declares. “Seriously, Val, you should write this down.”

Val eats another spoonful, savoring and analyzing. It is perfect. Distinct from Roman’s, but just as good.

Rowan brushes his long hair from his face and happily polishes off his bowl. Val watches him eat with an old, complicated twist in his heart. There will always be a part of him that longs for answers he’ll never receive. But he does know three things.

I loved him. I killed him. I saved him.

His dreams are quiet tonight.`

    description:`You would never have noticed it if you weren’t looking for it. That was precisely the point.


The instructions given in my embroidery group had been clear enough: After nightfall, take a stroll on the second lane past the bakery, look for the unlit lamppost and turn down that dark alley, they said in hushed voices, as the pianist began playing in sudden loud fervor, by coincidence. Then you will see a mossy stone staircase, which you will descend, and at the end of it there is a dim hallway. She lives through the set of green doors on the left.


The doors are tall and French like my husband’s mistress, but peeling and weathered. I can tell they were once painted a lovely shade of emerald green. Half of that green paint lies in small piles of flakes on the cobblestone. I debate knocking, and decide instead to reach with false confidence for the rusted copper handle. It turns downward easily. A small bell rings and echoes.


Welcome.


On the posters she is grotesque, an example of how time and sin turn a person sour, but in person she has the kind of enduring beauty you can’t tear your eyes away from.


Do come in darling, don’t be shy. Contrary to popular belief, I don’t bite. Although I can’t say nothing here does.


Her voice is like a wind chime, melodic and resonating, barely brushing over the crashing waves of her words. I wonder if I’m here too long if that voice will drag me out to deep sea. Or did that only work on men in the myths?


Take a seat, love. Yes, there is perfect. Would you like a cup of tea? Well, it’s never too late for tea, is it now? I enjoy it late into the night myself, but maybe you’ve been raised more proper than that. Here.


The cup is warm, not hot. If she noticed my shaking hands when reaching for it she didn’t say a word. It takes more than a few seconds for my eyes to adjust to the warmly lit room after a dark and shadowy street.


Among her many talents, it cannot be said that she was a good decorator. The shabby boards of the walls are empty but for an assortment of faded newspaper clippings from the highlights of her anonymous career. Obituaries, mostly. A tattered blue curtain with tassels hangs behind the armchair she’s perched in, dividing off part of the room. Eccentrically painted shelves house arrays of books and bottles of objects my gaze prefers not to settle on. She would have been called a witch for her collections had she not already acquired numerous more colorful nicknames by the public. The only item of some value is worn loosely around her slender wrist - a heavy and ornate gold watch. The kind of thing that would make a petty thief's day to see glinting underneath a man's sleeve in the street. She catches me admiring it and smiles thinly, holding up her arm up to eye-level.


Isn’t it a beauty? It was my first husband's, this watch. On the tenth anniversary of his death, I’m going to smash it to bits and melt the gold into a necklace for myself. I deserve a little gift from him, I think.


Her laugh unnerves me, but I find myself too curious to be afraid. I politely say my condolences for her husband’s death.


Oh darling, don’t be sorry that that man is dead. The one good thing he did was to be the inspiration for the charity work I do. I haven’t always done this. I used to be an actress, you know, a leading lady of the stage. Men would come from all over the city to see my shows, for I was beautiful then. Sometimes after the shows they would approach me, usually blind drunk, complimenting my dress or what was underneath it, asking for a kiss or a drink or a night. And sometimes they didn’t ask. My husband became my husband not because he asked but because he damaged me, and he was rich enough to get away with it and clever enough to know that marriage was my only option.


She smooths down the skirt of her maroon dress, then looks up at me with a solemn expression I can’t fully read. It isn’t hard to believe she was once a sought-after woman. Though sunken in age, her cheeks are smooth and her face looks as though it was hand-carved out of porcelain by God. Her hair is twisted into a dark crown atop her head, secured with metallic pins. Her eyes are like a cat’s, but not a house cat, no, definitely not. Like those of a tiger that has been left to go hungry for far too long. I will her to continue talking and not look at me with those eyes again. We sip our tea in unison, upholding our masquerade as ladies. She takes in a breath.


He said he loved me, and at the beginning I believed it. He may have loved me. He certainly desired me. I think mostly he loved seeing the desire and jealousy of other men when he told them I was his wife. But that got old fast. So did I, in his eyes. When it had been a year and I still had not given him a child, I turned ugly to him and he acted ugly accordingly.


One night, he came home from the pub talking about how the other men’s wives had filled their houses with children by now. He spoke of babies like cattle. Then he threatened that he ought to tell the whole town that I was secretly a whore and leave me. I should have kept quiet and obeyed and smothered him in his sleep, like a good wife. Instead, I promised him that as long as I was alive I would never let a child be born cursed enough to have him as a father. I’m sure you know what happens next, or otherwise you wouldn’t be here, my darling.


She traces a scar on her chin that I hadn’t noticed before, extending along her jaw to the start of the delicate bones of her neck. I imagine it snaking around the rest of her throat in a ring, strangling her pale skin, and my breath catches. It looks as if lightning struck her. She was struck, though not by something as rare as lightning.


I instinctively touch my collarbone where I know without looking there is a ghastly bruise. My modest neckline covers it, but somehow it feels like she knows it’s there, my mark of pain. I hope it goes away quickly so my husband does not think me unsightly. But then again, perhaps that will not be necessary. I nod at her meekly to show that I do know what happens next.


I can’t say whether he truly meant to kill me. But to hurt me, to wound me, to make my thoughts and words disappear in flames, he meant that with all his heart. The funny thing is it was him who made my words true. Of course, he couldn’t have known that I was with child. Even I did not know then. After, no one would ever get to know. I made a gravestone, although there was nothing to bury. And then a month later I buried my poor sick husband next to it, marked only with a slab that did not bear his name. Wealthy and beloved as his gold in his life, in death he became only stone. The disease had taken him so quickly that there was no time for anyone to save him. Shame on chance to take him from this world so young. Got him like…well, like poison, essentially.


The porcelain around her eyes cracks faintly in amusement. I have nothing to say in response, my mind stuck on the picture of a crude gravestone smaller than it should be.


Now, love. How would you like your tragedy to occur?


The widows in my town all chose differently. Most agree that the worse methods are only to be used for the worse husbands, but sometimes there is no rhyme or reason to it. After all, all’s fair in love and war. Millions of second and third and fourth thoughts crossed my mind on the way here, but now those voices are silent and there is only mine. Mine, and hers, and the input of the hissing wind outside.


Well? What will it be?


In two weeks it will happen. On the way home after a day of work, my husband will feel a bout of hopelessness that gives him a nudge to hurl himself off of the local bridge. The river below is not a kind one, especially to those who never learned to swim. He will have been drunk, since he often is and everyone knows how he gets when he’s drunk. No one will discuss a death as taboo as taking your own life. My children and I will cry and wear black for weeks, though no longer than what is expected. At the same time the black of our bruises will fade.


He won’t be missed very much, really. Perhaps that French woman will miss him, but she would have met the man that I knew soon enough. I will decide to raise my children in the countryside alone, and we will be happy. I cannot say yet whether I will regret it. The final time I will see the woman’s wild tiger's eyes, she will tell me that not once has she regretted anything in her life. She will say that it was a pleasure to do it, and fearfully I will believe her.


Oh, it really is getting late, love. Your family must be at home expecting you.


I reply that they are, and I thank her for her kindness, nervously reaching to shake her hand. How much blood has coated it? On the posters they say she has killed three men, but I know these were simply the times she wanted it enough to make it gruesome. The posters also envision her as grotesque, which means that they have not ever seen her, or the mark on her jaw from her fall after being struck by lightning. The posters know nothing. The men know nothing.


We women must stick together, yes?


The image of my young daughter appears and consumes my mind. I would do everything in my power to ensure she never has to know the instructions to get here. There will be no scars for my girl to trace, I will make sure of that.


I nod and drop the woman’s unassuming porcelain hand. Beneath the sound of her wind chime voice is a softer noise I hadn’t paid attention to before, almost like a breeze rustling through dying trees, overlaid with the humming of the Earth. It is separate from the wind and the rushing of my blood. She notices my piqued interest, and rather than say anything, stands, chuckles, and regally draws back the tattered blue curtain behind her. In view now is a cage, filled with twisting and writhing scaled bodies, hissing and competing with each other for air. They move as one, a trembling monster of green. I step back in sudden horror. She isn’t looking at me, but I see her eyes flash ravenously.


You don’t have to worry about them, darling. Their venom is reserved for the venomous.

    description:`Outside of the domed canopy of glass the martian dusk was gray and bleak, almost as gray and bleak as Mrs. Johnston felt, lying on a bed in Intensive Care, waiting to die. Earlier in the day a 4.5 magnitude marsquake had rattled the base camp, leaving one bathroom module destroyed and her room out of power, save for the backup oxygen filtration system, exhaling life into the room with a cool, watery hiss. She was reminded of her dead husband, the father of the martian O2 Filtration System. 


Her latter years had been a trial beyond description. Forty years prior, she had spent her last week on earth moving her family from the doomed coastal city they called home to a rocket launch site in the South of the country, where the government was preparing a ship that would rocket her and her prodigy untold miles into the cold, merciless dark of space, bound for a wind-blasted patch of dirt on a small, reddish planet known as mars. The United States Space Agency sent those with means to the red planet, or those with the required expertise–architects, botanists, biologists, engineers. Mrs. Johnston had neither. So she spent her childbearing years in a world that was degrading all around her. A world that, to her, was no different than a condemned home–man-high grass growing in the front lawn, the paint peeling, the roof liable to cave in at any moment. 


From the time she was twelve, Mrs. Johnston knew she wanted to go to mars. She studied picture books of mars, then moved on to textbooks, lingering over the diagrams as one gazes at a lover. She loved the coppery sand, the snow-capped peaks with their imprisoned moisture waiting to issue forth, to give life. Her books were her friends, the only things that promised to give her what she wanted. Walking through the halls of her highschool, she held her books close to her chest, and kept boy’s at arm’s length. She was almost driven off course, too. During her senior year, a gale of affection swept her from her desk into the arms of a slight, bespectacled boy named Clark–a boy with a ready smile and curly hair and brown eyes that seemed to glow when she was entrained in his stare. Clark made her feel something she had never felt before, welling up inside her like an embryo, a foreshadowing of what was to be the next great propulsive force in her life–her family. 


***


The wind whipped mutely against the scarred glass, tossing powdery, burnt-orange sand against it in fitful waves, like a hedgehog throwing up dirt. The setting sun was a blue-rimmed star sinking toward the dunes that made up her horizon. The honeycombed glass erased all sound except for the watery hiss of the ventilator, which filtered out carbon dioxide, combined the .16 percent of atmospheric oxygen with evaporated water, then released the mixture through a ventilation shaft above the automatic sliding door. Her husband was still giving her life now, even after what she’d done to him. The sound of the ventilator was like the steamy passage of a clothing iron–a sound of heat and moisture and condensation. On mars, the sound of life. Her mind was carried back to her mornings on earth when she would run the iron, hissing and sputtering, over a stubborn wrinkle in her husband’s slacks–he liked the creases knife-sharp. 


The sound of the ventilator lulled her into a fitful sleep. Some time later, she felt a hand touch hers. Startled at first, she relaxed as her eyes focused on her daughter standing by her bedside, her face–fresh and bright-eyed and pale from lack of sunlight–framed by shoulder-length brown hair that ended in a jaunty curl. How could she lie to such a being, her Jane, the one who trusted her now as faithfully as she did when she was too young to have an opinion of her own. She squeezed her fair, well-formed hand in her own gnarled one, and smiled faintly. Her daughter’s lips followed the path of her mother’s, and her eyes watered.


The sliding door opened and closed with a suck and a thump and someone else stepped in. It was her husband, David. He was twelve years old when she arrived on mars–two years her senior–an engineer’s apprentice and the son of doctor parents. Everyone in the colony was selected for their genome and academic performance, and he was no exception. Nothing was done by lottery–all was preordained. Except for her family. That was not preordained. 


Tim took his place beside his wife and rubbed her back. Jane let her head fall against his chest and her shoulders shook in a silent sob. Mrs. Johnston slipped back into her reverie.


Two years before Jane was born, Clark began interning at a research program that was well-known for sending rovers into space–the Space Robotics Research Institute. Clark’s boss at the Institute was connected to the eggheads at the Space Program, which was busy formulating plans for the first martian colony in human history. Meanwhile, Mrs. Johnston married Clark, bore his children, and dropped out of college. Gone were the days where visions of a crumbling earth would haunt her dreams, nights when she would snap awake in a cold sweat and, unable to go back to sleep, read another chapter on martian weather patterns. But she had not forgotten her mission.


The world was at a new stage of crisis. Mrs. Johnston remembered pushing Jane’s stroller through smog until she finally bought a cloth mask for her and her daughter. The roads were twelve lanes across and jammed with self-driving trucks and cars. The city was a fiefdom of parking lots. Sidewalks fell into disrepair, crumbling and weed-eaten. Street lights blazed at all hours, compensating for the 24/7 gloom–the cloud of pollutants released into the air in an attempt to block the UV rays penetrating the ozone layer. It was a failed experiment in weather-control that enshrouded her city in a forever-dusk. To walk outside was to feel the twilight of humankind, when time’s streams would empty into a great sea in which time itself would lose its forward motion. So Mrs. Johnston would walk in darkness, pushing Jane in her stroller or crossing the twelve-lane road to get to the superstore on the other side.


***


A third person walked through the sliding glass doors. Her only son, Jim. He wore a plaid wool shirt and blue jeans. His hair was combed neatly across his brow and made a shiny black roof over his head. His jaw tightened on entering the room. Mrs. Johnston held out her hand, the matriarch extending a final blessing to her son. He took it and brought it to his heart. If only they could understand why I did it, she thought, then I could die in peace. 


But peace, she knew, was never her lot. Time had continued to pass on the speck of blue she called home, a home riddled with crime and bureaucratic bloat and pollution and institutionalized idleness and anomie and wars of attrition raging across the globe like slow-burning forest fires, leaving black acres in their wake from which nothing would grow again. She knew she had to make her move soon. She asked Clark whether he could get them and their children on a rocket to mars. Just pull a few strings, she told him. He was adamant that he couldn’t leave. Besides being impossible–there was a strict screening process, and Jane and Jim’s test scores simply weren’t high enough–leaving would be a betrayal of his aging parents, his work for humanity.


One month later, on a broiling Saturday evening during the summer of 2090, her husband did not return home from work. Mrs. Johnston called the police, filed a report in frantic tones as the operator told her to calm down. She broke the news to her children. The only trace of him was his car in the company lot, parked in the same spot he’d pulled into every morning for the past ten years–that, and the briefcase on his nightstand. 


For years, he had added to a collection of notes that filled up a triple-latched briefcase he kept locked in a filing cabinet next to his work desk. The day before his disappearance, Mrs. Johnston had asked him to show it to her. The briefcase made her so very curious, she told him. She knew he hid it to prevent young strivers from stealing his work, a sure breakthrough in the field of aerospace. That night, they had a pillow talk. It was his private project, he told her–him flushed and sweaty in the post-coital peace, her giving him a look of wanton affection–but it was connected to the mission of the institute: the blueprints for an air filtration system that would convert the toxic atmosphere of mars (which was 95 percent carbon dioxide, he reminded her) into breathable air, and do so for as long and with as little maintenance as possible. His bosses knew the briefcase was important, he told her, but to keep him from defecting to another lab, they let him maintain his secrecy, trusting that they would have full access to his prodigious mind when the time was ripe. So they thought. 


After his disappearance, the Institute made a visit to the Johnston home. She was watching the hologram, washcloth in her lap, staring unblinkingly at images of forest fires and tent cities and refugees stumbling in a haze of concrete dust from an explosion. She switched to the local news and saw the dark cloud of pollutants hanging over her city like the plague of gnats over Egypt. The knock came in three quick raps. 


The man standing at the door was dressed in a dark suit, his white undershirt bisected by a black pencil tie. He wore the lines of experience and age, weathered into his face like glacier-made fissures, and there was a hardness to his eyes that chilled her. “I’m Doctor Wallace, representing the Research Institute.” He smiled and his eyes wandered over her shoulder. “May I come inside?” 


She said yes, of course he could, and asked if he wouldn’t like something to drink. He declined with a quick head-shake and smile, seating himself on one of the couches and smoothing his tie as he did so. Mrs. Johnston’s heart was pounding. The man opened by saying how sorry he was about her husband’s disappearance, and that the Institute was pursuing every possible lead in cooperation with law enforcement. She must know that he was very dear to the company, not only as a lead researcher but as a human being. “He was especially fond of his family,” he said with something resembling warmth, and he took her hand in his. Strong, meaty hands, she thought. Hands that could kill. 


“But now,” he went on delicately, “we need something from you Mrs. Johnston.” 


Again, his eyes flickered over her shoulder in the same time it would take her to blink. “Mrs. Johnston, you and I know how very important your husband was to the company. He was one of our best researchers–our best brain, as I liked to say,” he said with a faint chuckle, patting her hand. “But there was some research he kept to himself, that he was planning to share with us when he thought it was ready. Ever the perfectionist, he stayed true to his word and–” 


“You can’t have the briefcase.” 


“The man’s grip tightened for a moment and some of the hardness came back into his eyes. They were gray, like sand-blasted concrete. “Excuse me?” 


She withdrew her hand from his tightening grip. “I appreciate you coming over, she said. “I really do, but you can’t have access to my husband’s notes.” 


“Excuse me Mrs. Johnston, but that would be against your husband’s wishes–”


“Unless–” she continued, stammering– “Unless you can guarantee me and my family safe passage to mars on the Destiny V.” 


“Ma’am, you know very well I can’t give you a free spot on that rocket–” 


“Then you can leave this house and never come back, because you’re not getting my husband’s blueprints for the machine that’s going to keep your people alive!” 


She stood up, chest heaving, eyes wide with fear and euphoria. The man’s gaze hardened and he rose from the couch, eyes drifting over her shoulder again. He took a small step toward her. 


“Andrew, call 9-1-1,” she said, trembling. 


A synthetic male voice spoke to her from a wall-mounted screen: “Calling 9-1-1.” 


The man chuckled to himself and shook his head. He was done trying to cage this cat. Before she could do anything else, he shot her a look of unbridled disdain and left the house, closing the door behind him. Mrs. Johnston crumpled to the ground, and sat there for a long time. 


The next day she received a call. Provided she would give them her husband’s notes, the Institute would give Mrs. Johnston and her family a free ride to mars. They would consider it her husband’s severance pay, but her children would be inducted into the Martian Academy of Science upon arrival. Every breath they breathed on the red planet would be in service to the colony.


On launch day, her alarm woke her at 4:30. She roused her children, set the tea boiling on the stove, knifed a square of butter into a warming pan, and took eggs out of the fridge for breakfast. She, Jane and Jim were packed and ready to leave the house by 5:50. The children knew they were going to mars, and that seemed a sufficient distraction from the reality of their father’s disappearance. The detectives assigned to the case found nothing in his workplace or home to suggest foul play, save for the strong smell of antiseptic coming from the master bathroom. Mrs. Johnston told them she cleaned the bathtub before he went missing. They seemed to accept her explanation, but her mind knew the truth. Every night she woke up screaming for him to leave her alone. His kind, bespectacled, blood-spattered face seemed to hover in the darkened doorway of the room they had shared, a ghostly afterimage in the grainy darkness. 


She spent her last few nights on earth sleeping on the living-room couch. 


***


“Oh, if you could just forgive me, I could die in peace.” 


Jane’s eyes quivered, then spilled their tears. “What? Mom? What do you mean forgive you, you saved us." She took her hand again, holding it tight. Jim followed suit, never taking his eyes off her. “It’s only because of you that we’re here,” she said.


“It’s your father–he’s why you’re here,” she choked. The tears flowed freely now, the dam finally broken under years of boiling floodwaters. Rivers coursed silently down her pale, papery cheeks. Her mouth widened in a rictus of pain. 


“Mom!” Jane grabbed a tissue from the bedside table and thrust it into her mother’s trembling fist. “Mom, don’t cry.” 


“Oh, Jane,” Mrs. Johnston warbled, “Your father–your father is dead because of me.”


Her daughter's hand went limp. 


***


Launch day unfolded with all the coiled anticipation of birth and death put together. 


Every moment was a crescendo building to the next. Mrs. Johnston and her children rode the bus to the launch station, the morning black outside the wall-to-wall windows. She blinked away her tears before the children could see. Every minute, she got closer to the red rock 140 million miles away, her constant companion through years of death and decay. Sitting there, her old life coming undone with each passing mile, she tried to imagine a place where the temperature dipped to 100 degrees below zero and sandstorms swirled in cyclones the diameter of cities. A place of endless black and orange sand the consistency of baby powder and dunes dusted with snow. A place where her death would mean a new birth, where her husband’s death would not be in vain. 


***


The attendants strapped them into seats in the passenger compartment of the rocket, an hulking scythe of laser-cut aluminum and solar panels sitting at the bottom of an underground silo that would catapult them into the stratosphere at a speed of 30,000 miles per hour. The silo was so deep the sky appeared as a quarter-sized circle of pink-tinged cloud outside the starboard porthole, their world reduced to the bare glimpse afforded by a keyhole, a gap in a fence. Mrs. Johnston looked on, exhausted and numb. The attendant pressed a button on the side of her helmet and the fiberglass visor sealed her in a world of silence, save for whatever came through the built-in headset.


The voice of the pilots and mission control crackled in her ears. 


“Okay, align wingtips.”


“Roger.” 


“S-1 pre-press.” 


“Roger.” 


“Thirty seconds.” 


“GDC is good.” 


“Twenty seconds and counting.” 


“Roger.” 


“Ok. Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen…”


Mrs. Johnston glanced sideways at her children, harnessed to their chairs and scanning the computerized walls of the rocket, the myriad buttons and touchscreen surfaces. Jane was glued to a monitor showing live footage of the earth at ground level–a patchwork of green farmland as far as the eye could see. Sunswept ranges of cumulonimbus clouds. A rare beauty. The rocket shook, and she and her brother looked at their mother. As the thrusters boiled beneath them, as the rocket shuddered into the air and everything was overcome white light, Mrs. Johnston wondered if she had made the right decision.

    description:`Daniel sat in a bright cubic cell. He perched on the edge of a ledge, slightly too small to be a bed, that herniated out of the smooth clean wall. A black lens was set into the ceiling and looked down on him like a shark’s eye. 


The door swung open and a man wearing a grey suit and a blue veil of fag smoke stepped into the cold cell. The man turned to watch the door close behind him and then leant against it, scratching audibly at dandruff with a hooked yellow finger.


“Good morning,” said the man.


“Are you my solicitor?” said Daniel.


“If you are Mr Daniel Kopie, then I am your legal adviser.”


“What do I call you?”  


“You have paid for our Bronze level of service. I’m afraid you only get a named fee earner at Silver and above.”


“What else do I get if I pay for the Silver service?”


“A named Fee Earner who has between two and five years of experience. The level of experience your Fee Earner has is important, especially if the charges are serious.”


“What are the charges against me?”


“I don’t know.”


“Well how do I know what level of package I need?”


“Personally, I wouldn’t go for anything less than Gold. You get a named Fee Earner with five to ten years under their belt. Between you and me, I was doing Platinum packages until recently, but I’ve just started with this firm and I’m only allowed to do Bronze jobs for the duration of my probation period.”


“That’s good, you’ve got lots of experience then? That’s good, I’ve never been arrested before. Never been in any trouble at all, actually. I have no idea what’s going on, two blokes just came and arrested me at the bank. They were plain clothes officers; they said I had to go with them. This whole thing is a mistake.”


“Right, yeah, I’ve got loads of experience but I can only advise you to the Bronze level today, which doesn’t include assessing the legality of the arrest. You could upgrade if you like? You just need to make the additional payment.”


“But they have my wallet, my phone, everything.”


“Bronze it is then.” The man shrugged, peeled himself from the door and began to pace back and forth across the small room. He trotted like a half-mad zoo animal and spoke to his own scuffed brogues. “Tell me something you’ve done wrong.”


“What? I’m not a criminal,” said Daniel, straightening on his perch.


“Yeah, right, of course, but give me something. Trust me, this is a good tactic for Bronzers. Nothing too serious, but not nothing. Has there been a time when you’ve forgotten to scan absolutely everything in your basket at the self-checkout in the supermarket? Have you ever parked illegally? Maybe a bit of speeding on the motorway?” The trivial criminality of every suggestion was shrugged away as the man paced, hands lazily swatting away any concern Daniel may have about admitting to such minor indiscretions.  


“Something illegal but common?” said Daniel.


“Yeah, you know the type of thing, everyone’s done it, but nothing too serious.”


Daniel folded his arms and shifted on the hard ledge. “I mean… I might have slightly overestimated the value of some of my possessions when I insured the contents of my house.”


“Christ! Not that.” The man stopped and turned on his heel. “That’s a crime of dishonesty, insurance fraud, they’ll throw the book at you and it’ll undermine any evidence that you give. Bloody hell. I’ll pretend that I didn’t hear that.” The man patted all of his pockets in turn, chasing the ghost of absent cigarettes around his battered suit.


“It’s not that bad,” said Daniel. “The value of taxidermy squirrels fluctuates. You could argue that I’ve actually undervalued my collection.” 


“I will not be making that argument,” said the man, giving up his reflexive search for cigarettes that he knew he had been forbidden to bring into the cell.


“We could get an expert to value them.”


“A stuffed squirrel expert?” said the man, folding his arms and looking coldly at Daniel with glass eyes.


“Yes. They’re out there, there’s a whole collecting community. I’m a bit of an expert myself, actually. I don’t suppose we can use me though, can we?”


“We can’t use anyone, we’re not instructing experts on a Bronze fee. Look, shut up and give me something else to work with. We need a sacrifice; we need to have something ready that you would be plausibly apologising for.”


“Why? Why would I be apologising at all? I haven’t done anything wrong.”


“First of all, you have, everyone’s done something. Secondly, because we’re going to make an apology before anything else happens. Contrition now will go a long way later on. We need to get in there early and show that you’re remorseful. It could reduce any future sentence.”


“Sentence! But I haven’t been found guilty of anything. I don’t even know what the charge is. If I apologise now, it will look like I’m guilty of an unknown crime.”


“It might, but if the charge turns out to be something awful that you don’t want to cop to, we can say that the apology was made for the minor thing, not bloody insurance fraud, but something they can deal with quickly, give you a fine or a really short sentence.”


“Short sentence! There you go again.” Daniel was on his feet now. “I haven’t done anything wrong. Let’s just find out what the charge is and take it from there, shall we?”


“No,” said the man, looking Daniel up and down from his shoeless feet to the open neck of his untucked, crumpled shirt. “Get the apology in now. Look,” the man placed a hand on Daniel’s shoulder, “since the reforms the conviction rate has gone through the roof. Your chances of acquittal today are about 8%.” The man applied a smoothly increasing pressure and Daniel folded back down onto the hard ledge.


“What about innocent until proven guilty?” said Daniel with a shake of his head.


“Oh yeah, well, you still are, of course. It’s just that there’s a 92% chance that you will be found guilty and when you are there’s a 100% chance that you’ll be sentenced, and the sentencing guidelines say that they can take remorse and early acceptance of guilt into account. The earlier the better.”


“So, your legal advice is to just apologise for something I haven’t even done, without knowing what the alleged offence even is?”


“Yes. But with a sacrificial minor crime up our sleeve, just in case the charge turns out to be something really grim. Something bad enough to make it worth gambling when the odds are 1/11. Are you a gambler? Going for the Bronze package suggests that maybe you are, if you don’t mind me saying so.”


Daniel let his head fall back and looked up at the camera in the middle of the ceiling. “I can’t believe it, it’s…”


“Don’t say it,” said the man, a thick finger raised in paternal warning.  


“It’s Kafkaesque,” said Daniel staring into the shark’s eye.  


“Great, nice one, cheers for that,” said the man turning away and slapping both palms against the cell wall.


“What are you talking about?”


“The new reforms have made it clear that section 4 of the Public Order Act 1986 can be applied where the alleged victim is the state, or any emanation of the state, for example, a court, and the guidance lists the word Kafkaesque as an example of abusive or insulting language,” said the man to the wall, head hanging between his spread arms. “So, you’ve just committed the offence of intentionally causing harassment, alarm or distress.”  


“They’ve made it illegal to say that the court system is Kafkaesque?”


“Yes. And as an officer of the court, I have to report it.” To emphasise the point and make it clear that he had no choice in the matter, the man took one hand from the wall and pointed up at the black camera lens.  


“But earlier you said, I’ll pretend that I didn’t hear that, about the squirrel thing.”


“There’s no guidance about squirrel-based insurance fraud.” The man turned and slumped with his back against the wall.” He frowned and looked down into the corner of the room, searching an unseen text. “Yet.” He looked up at Daniel and smiled, showing a sliver of magnolia dentistry. “It’s a grey area. A grey squirrel area.”


“So, I’ve committed an offence by saying that something is Kafkaesque, even though it is Kafkaesque and my own lawyer has to report me for it?”


“You’ve now committed the offence four times and I have to fill in a separate form for each one, so please don’t say it again.”


“But that’s…”


“Yes, it is,” said the man stepping forward and clamping his hand over Daniel’s mouth. Daniel could taste salt on the hard palm and smell the acrid tang of the man’s nicotine habit on his worn grey cuff. “But we must uphold the rule of law,” he said, staring hard into Daniel’s eyes. “Can’t have people throwing the K word around.” A grin split his face into a delta of crow’s feet. “Or the public will lose faith.”


The two men stared at each other over the hairy ridge of the man’s hand. After a few long seconds the man took his hand from Daniel’s mouth and straightened, returning to his repetitive three-pace measuring of the small cell. 


“This is unbelievable,” said Daniel, watching the man’s bluebottle patrol. “How can that possibly be a crime?”


“Wait! That’s it,” said the man, stopping and stooping to clap his hands to Daniel’s upper arms, pulling him to his feet. “That’s your crime. I’ll make my report, then you make your apology and then when we get the charges we decide whether you were apologising for the crime we know about, your repeated use of the K word, or the mystery crime. If the mystery crime is something really grim then we tie the apology to the K word incidents and you can then decide if you want to do another apology for the big one, or take your 1/11 shot at acquittal.” His grin buckled under the weight of a sudden frown and he pushed Daniel back down onto the ledge. “Of course, in your case the odds will be much worse than that.”


“Why?” sighed Daniel, his tiredness complete, the word interrogating not just the matter of his worsening odds, but everything that had happened to him since he had looked up from his spam sandwich to see two unfamiliar men standing by his desk in the bank. Laura from HR had handed him his coat before he even stood up. He’d looked at her dumbly, crumbs on his tie. He wished he’s taken one more bite before they took the sandwich off him and put him in the van.  


“Well, all of the public order offences you’ve just committed will be taken into account.”


The man’s words brought Daniel back into the cell. “I don’t know what’s happening. I don’t know what to do,” he said, raising a hand to his chest, where his crumby tie had hung before they confiscated it, along with his shoes and belt and wallet and phone, all of the personal furniture of a normal day.


The man and the shark’s eye lens stared down at Daniel. “Just say you’re sorry. It’s your best bet.”


Daniel nodded and turned to the wall, lowering himself into a foetal coil on the hard ledge. “I’m sorry,” he said, before the cell door slammed shut and the light blinked out.    `

    description:`After uttering his last words, he closed his eyes and never opened them again. His mouth was still open, as if he had run out of energy halfway through closing it. He inhaled the tiniest bit of air, savored it one last time, and after letting it escape, he was gone


There lay my father. Or rather, there now lay his body - a vessel of flesh that had housed his immortal soul for the past eighty-seven years. What had been a strong and solid home at first had grown fragile with the passing years, until in the end it was nothing but a decaying uninhabitable shell.


It was the end of July, and we were baking in a 30-degree heatwave - I was at my father’s farmhouse in the village of Fiveoaks, Cambridgeshire where he had lived his entire life. Even with the curtains drawn the room was too warm, and I knew I had to move fast before the heat did too much damage to the fragile lifeless frame he had left behind. The undertaker would be waiting for my call, all arrangements had already been made.


Before reaching for the phone, I allowed myself to sit in silence just a moment longer. I had been keeping watch in the large armchair next to his bed for the last three days. I had barely slept waiting for the inevitable, determined to ensure he would not be alone in his final moment, perhaps even hoping to catch a glimpse when it came. Something to reassure me of what came next. I am not a young man myself and the thought of death made me nervous. 


I had seen nothing of the great beyond and instead was now paralysed by an oncoming wave of grief, as well as shock that came with my dying father’s last words: 


"I killed her. I killed Maureen Chapman.” 


***


In 1975 when I was sixteen years old Maureen Chapman disappeared. 


Through most of our early childhood she and I had gone to the same primary school. We were never particularly close but as children of similar age living in a small village we spent much time together, mostly as part of a larger group but sometimes on our own. When we were fourteen our schooling went in different directions - as the other local children I too went to the village Grammar while Maureen was sent to a fine private school some distance away. 


Her brother Michael, who was in the same year group as my little sister Sarah, followed Maureen’s footsteps; Sarah, who was born with mild Down Syndrome and struggled in regular school was accepted to a private special-ed school. Sarah died five years ago in a freak car accident; her life was long, healthy and fulfilling thanks to the school that gave her the support she needed early on in life.


Maureen and Michael had been raised by a single mother. Nancy moved to the village with two small children and no husband many years before her daughter’s disappearance. She made no secret of the fact that the children’s father was not actively involved in their lives and while normally this would have set tongues wagging, Nancy was so charming everyone here fell in love with her instantly. 


Nancy worked as a secretary at an investment firm based in Cambridge, had done so for many years. When Maureen was eleven and Michael nine, the founder of the firm Reginald Lawson died. A rather unremarkable event given his advanced years but when his will was read it transpired that Nancy had been his mistress for the best part of two decades, and that he was the father of both her children.  


In his will he claimed to have loved them all very much and to make up for his failures in life, he left them his entire fortune. The will also disinherited his lawful wife and grown son, both of whom Reginald had a falling out with years prior, and had not spoken to since. 


The two of them contested the will and it took Nancy and her children two years to finally receive their share of the estate by which time the entire county knew her name and face, as well as those of her children. Nancy remained dignified through the unpleasantness, and the village stood by her the entire time. The case was eventually settled, and Nancy emerged a wealthy woman, yet made very few changes to her old life except for sending the children to best private schools in the county. 


***


The last time anyone saw Maureen was Saturday at her boarding school. She had stayed behind for the weekend as her mother and brother had gone to London to see a play and she did not want to be bored on her own at Fiveoaks. Her roommate at school was also away and Maureen’s disappearance went unnoticed until the following morning. After receiving a call from school on Sunday, Nancy alerted the police. 


The grounds and nearby woodlands were searched thoroughly, the river and two small lakes dragged. Maureen’s schoolmates were questioned, especially those who were present over the weekend, as were locally known criminals, particularly those known for bothering young girls. There were police everywhere but no sign of Maureen. 


A week passed with no meaningful leads until a ransom letter arrived at Nancy’s house. It had been held up by a postal strike of all things! The letter demanded £100,000 in exchange for the girl; the date of the swap was to be the very same night. Nancy was distraught but also now more hopeful that her daughter was still alive. 


The letter instructed Nancy to drop the money in a bag behind a red postbox near the supermarket parking lot at 11pm - after the kidnapper has successfully retrieved it her daughter would be returned. She was to come alone. Nancy took on the task of dropping the money while two policemen set up near the back of the dark parking lot to catch the kidnapper in action and thus ensure the girl would be found. 


Nancy arrived at the drop-off alone as had been instructed. She dropped the money behind the postbox and left. After she had gone a car pulled into the parking lot, and the people in the car were immediately arrested – they were Jake Malone and Cindy Travers, two teenagers from the village on a rendezvous. The kids, looking rather sheepish, were let go after a short interrogation; when the police went to check on the money it was gone. The kidnapper had taken it in the middle of the chaos and left in the dark without anyone noticing a thing. 


Hours passed, and then days, but there was no sign of Maureen. Then a week went by, a month, and eventually a year. The ongoing active investigation which included several interviews with both Reginald’s scorned wife and disgruntled son, yielded no results, and eventually the case went cold. It was however never officially closed and every now and again, even decades later the police would follow up on new leads or take a fresh look at the old ones. 


It has now been more than forty years. Michael lives in Canada with his family, Nancy passed fifteen years ago from cancer, having never learned what happened to her daughter. She died hopeful that perhaps Maureen, having grown tired of the tabloid circus that surrounded her life, simply chose to disappear, and that whoever had demanded the ransom money was nothing more than an opportunist.


In the end she convinced herself that her daughter was out there somewhere, living in peace and perhaps married with a family of her own. In her final moments, dosed up on morphine, she hallucinated that Maureen was by her bedside, and died with a weak smile on her face. 


I however now knew the truth. 


***


"I took her from her room - the windows faced outside on the ground flood, and she was a slight girl, so it was not very difficult. I climbed in, and I waited until she came back from the bathroom which was in the hallway. I covered her mouth with tape so she couldn’t scream and then I dragged her outside. I was fast, she had no time to react and there was no mess in the room - you see, that’s why Nancy thought maybe Maureen ran away because it was so tidy in there. When we got in the car that was hidden behind the hedge, I dropped her on the back seat and drove away. I saw her face in the rearview mirror, she was so confused when she recognised me. She had known me most of her life, and she didn’t understand why I was doing what I was doing, the poor girl. I explained it, I kept telling her we needed the money - for Sarah. Sarah was doing so badly in that school - no one gave her the care she needed. She was such a bright girl, and she deserved so much more. We couldn’t afford that special-ed school, and we had the farm so we couldn’t have the scholarship either. We needed to help Sarah, and we needed money for that. I think she understood, you know. Maureen did. I swear, she understood, and she wanted to help. Maureen was such a good girl; she was so kind, and she was always so nice to Sarah. Michael too - he helped her with her homework, you know. I had prepared everything for Maureen in the disused stables, she had blankets, books, and I got her food every day. And then when I got the money and came back to let her go home, she was dead! I didn’t hurt her, I swear. She had been on the upper ledge, where the old stacks of firewood used to be. She had slipped down and couldn’t get up from there, and the ropes that I had used to tie her... well, she had strangled herself with them by accident. I swear it was an accident. I did not mean to kill her. I swear!” 


I stared at my father in disbelief as he came to the end of his deathbed confession. His speech was just whizzing now - he used up all his energy to tell me what happened, and I held my breath the entire time as if me using less air somehow allowed him to have more. 


“God forgive me. I killed her. I killed Maureen Chapman.” 


***


The week between his death and the funeral were harder than I had expected. I suppose that is normal but not only was I burying my father whom I had loved all my life, all sixty years of it, I was also coming to terms with the man I may have never really known.  


The evening after the funeral I sat on the front porch of his farmhouse, and for the first time since the confession, I allowed myself to have a truthful conversation with my conscience whom I had kept at bay until then.


Was it true what my father had said? Could he have hallucinated it all - like many people do when they are dying? Did he make it all up just for the hell of it?! That didn’t make sense. False death bed confessions were not unheard of either, especially with very old people. But if it was true, did he do it for the reasons he said he did? Was it for Sarah or was it for something else? Sure, Sarah did go to the special school in the end and none of us questioned how dad had made it happen. From then on Sarah’s life had run a beautiful course, better than anyone in her condition could have expected. Things are better now for people like her, but this was the 70s in rural England, she had little chance. But a chance is what my parents had given her. My parents... Did my mother know? And if so, how much? And did Maureen really die the way he had said, or did he kill her intentionally, maybe right after he kidnapped her? After all, she had seen his face, would he have risked letting her go after that? It made no sense. Or did he make that part up? But I couldn’t also see how my father, the gentle and kind soul I had known, did any of it. Maybe it is true - no one ever really knows the people they love. And where is Maureen now? Dad never got a chance to tell me what happened after she died. In the end I was left with more questions than answers.  


I debated with myself. He was gone now. My mother went long before him. Sarah was gone too. I never married nor had children so there was no one left to protect in my family. But Nancy was also gone. Only Michael was out there somewhere, living his life in Canada, far away from Fiveoaks and all the sadness this place would have meant for him. Yet even that far away he would no doubt be still wondering what happened to his big sister, and his heart would always be broken from the pain he had witnessed his mother endure. He was now the only living link to Maureen, other than me. We were the only two people left, and our lives would always be intertwined even if we had not seen each other, not even thought of each other for forty years. 


I stood up and looked down from the porch to the rose garden in front of it. It was in full bloom and the beautiful scent was overpowering in the warm summer evening. This was my father’s garden - he had almost obsessively tended to it since it was planted close to my 17 birthday. He loved it deeply and I didn’t need to dig it up to know this is where Maureen was buried. 


The next morning, I booked a flight to Toronto.  `
