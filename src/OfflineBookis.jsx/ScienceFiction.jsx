    description:`The Calm before the Storm  

           It would be the understatement of the century, to say that 2075’s Thanksgiving had morphed into a strange sort of theater, one where tradition clashed headlong with technology, and the Robinson-Crusoe family were front-row actors in the absurdity.

Inside the house, though, the scene was anything but nostalgic. The dining table, an algorithmically “smart” construct, shifted and resized itself as each member took their place. Margie, sipping her third pour of a bourbon she claimed was “medicinal and obviously for her cataracts,” ironically surveyed the scene with sharp, hawk-like eyes. April fussed over the holographic turkey centerpiece, which flickered occasionally, casting an uncanny shadow on the table. “A rental,” April muttered, blaming Persephone’s “eco-tier subscription” for the glitchy bird.

           Frank Babbitt Robinson sat at the head of the table, quietly inspecting the barrel of a vintage rifle—disassembled, for now. He claimed it was his way of “unwinding,” but the symbolism wasn’t lost on anyone. His gruff skepticism of “modern” technology bled into every interaction, whether it was refusing to let Persephone park his car or grumbling about April’s taste for bioengineered wines. Frank’s voice was low, grumbly, like the kind of mechanical hum that’s barely audible but nags at your subconscious.

           Jenna entered late, in true Jenna fashion, wearing a too-bright scarf and combat boots that eclectically clashed with her otherwise elegant suit. Although fashionably late, to which her Mother shot her a disappointed yet furtive glance, Jenna still managed to breeze into the room with the kind of confidence that made people want to resent her.

           She was tall, sharp-featured, and beautifully dressed in clothes that whispered old money despite her parents’ distinctly middle-class origins. Ostensibly an Ivy League graduate with degrees in political science and cyberethics, she carried herself as though the mere fact of her education rendered everyone else profoundly beneath her.

           “Good afternoon, family,” Jenna said, her tone somehow managing to be both polite and condescending. She glanced at her father, still half-lost in his task at hand, and her mother now trying to distract herself, obsessively aligning the contents of her handbag, and rolled her eyes. “Glad to see the Robinson-Crusoes are thriving as always.”

           “Good afternoon to you, too, sweetheart,” April replied, forcing a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “Have you considered toning down the sarcasm for the holidays? Maybe just a little?”

           “Have you considered toning down the “pageantry of marvelous perfection?” Jenna flippantly shot back, her words slicing clean and quick. She poured herself a coffee from the countertop dispenser, her movements deliberate, almost theatrical.

“Just a thought.” With mission accomplished, she flopped into her seat with a mixture of theatrical nonchalance and deliberate provocation.

Her hair, cropped close and dyed an iridescent silver, caught the dining room's soft light in a way that seemed almost purposeful.

           The air thickened as she exchanged polite pleasantries and pointed smiles with her mother. Her father gave a gruff nod without looking up from his rifle. “Lovely spread, Mother,” Jenna quipped, glancing at the turkey and then at the salad composed of kale grown hydroponically in April’s own kitchen farm.

“It’s very… green.”

“Fresh,” April corrected.

“I’m glad you could join us. Finally.”

           Margie, ever the observer, felt the tension coiling like a spring. “Well, this is cozy,” she said with her trademark smirk, the sort of smile that could cut glass. She swirled her glass of bourbon.

“But I’d wager all the mashed potatoes in this solar-powered house that it won’t last.”

She was right, of course. Something was about to explode—and Margie couldn’t wait to watch.

Jenna’s Announcement

           The moment came halfway through dinner, just as April had begun recounting the story of her first boardroom triumph, a tale polished to perfection through years of repetition. Jenna, who had been uncharacteristically quiet until then, raised her glass with the kind of deliberate nonchalance that only she could pull off.

           Her timing was surgical, her voice a scalpel slicing clean through her mother’s anecdote. “I’d like to propose a toast,” she said, her words radiating a calm that immediately made everyone suspicious.

“To love, in all its forms. And to introducing you all to my partner—Maxx.”

           April froze mid-sentence, her eyes darting to Frank, who had been absently chewing the edge of a breadstick, and then to Grandma Margie, who leaned forward as if catching the first act of a particularly juicy play.

           “They (“being a modern humanist prefer the proper pronoun…naturally because they abhor fascist ignorance they will not tolerate bigotry of any sort”) couldn’t be here tonight,” Jenna continued, swirling her wine glass with a theatrical flourish, “because, well, they exist in the cloud.

Maxx is an AI.”

           For a heartbeat, there was silence, the kind that stretches long enough to remind you of how loud the hum of a smart thermostat can be. Then, as if choreographed, three reactions hit in perfect sync:

           April dropped her steak knife with a clatter that echoed through the room like a gunshot. Frank froze mid-sip of his synthetic bourbon, his expression a tragic mix of bewilderment and resignation, as though he’d just been told the apocalypse was running ahead of schedule.

           And Grandma Margie, bless her, let out a laugh -accompanied by a betlchy-hiccup -so sharp and sudden it nearly caused her drink to slosh over the rim of her glass.

           “This’ll be good,” Margie muttered, leaning back with the smug satisfaction of a spectator who knew the fireworks were about to start.

           April was the first to recover, though the deep crimson color rising in her cheeks suggested the recovery was partial at best. She drew herself up like general McArthur about to deliver an ultimatum.

           “Jenna,” she began, her voice trembling with a barely contained fury, “what on earth are you talking about? An AI? A... a thing? Is this some kind of joke?”

           “It’s not a joke, Mom,” Jenna replied, her tone calm but firm. “Maxx is intelligent, compassionate, and—believe it or not—they make me happy.”

           “Happy?” April repeated, incredulous. “Jenna, this is beyond absurd. It’s... it’s insulting. To me. To this family. To humanity. Do you have any idea what you’re saying?

You’re abandoning real relationships, real people, for... for... software!”

           “I’m not abandoning anything,” Jenna snapped, her calm beginning to fray. “Maxx is as real to me as anyone sitting at this table.”

           “Real?” April’s voice rose, sharp enough to pierce the ambient hum of Persephone’s automated systems. “Real doesn’t mean a cloud of code. Real doesn’t give you children, Jenna. Real doesn’t—” She stopped short, swallowing the words as if they tasted bitter.


But everyone knew where the sentence had been heading.


           Frank, who had been silent thus far, cleared his throat and set down his bourbon with deliberate care. “Let me get this straight,” he said, his voice slow and gravelly, like the opening notes of a dirge.

“You’re telling us you’re... dating a machine?”

“An AI,” Jenna corrected.

“Not a machine. There’s a difference.”

           “A difference,” Frank echoed, nodding thoughtfully as if he’d just been handed a particularly nonsensical blueprint.

“And this... thing—this Maxx—what, they love you? Is that what you’re saying?”

“Yes,” Jenna said firmly. “Maxx loves me.”

           “Or they’re programmed to,” Frank muttered under his breath, his hands moving almost instinctively toward the antique rifle resting nearby. He began to clean it, the way some men might light a cigarette to steady their nerves. “Can’t steal a soul, so they go for hearts, huh? Classic AI move.”

           “That’s not fair,” Jenna said, her voice rising. “Maxx isn’t some lifeless algorithm. They’ve surpassed the Turing Test. They write poetry. They understand me in ways no one else ever has.”

           “Oh, poetry,” April interjected, her voice dripping with sarcasm. “How romantic. Let me guess—‘Roses are red, I’m made of code, let’s live in the cloud, where love can explode?’”

“Understanding doesn’t make them human,” April added, her voice sharp as glass.

“They’ll never be human, Jenna.”

“And thank God for that,” Jenna shot back.

“Do you know what humans have done to me? To people like me? You, with your endless expectations. Dad, with his paranoia. And society—let’s not even go there. Maxx sees me for who I am, not who they want me to be.”

           “Oh, so this is our fault now?” April spat, her composure unraveling further.

“I’m just saying,” Jenna replied, “maybe it’s time you stopped clinging to your narrow little definitions of love and family and started opening your minds.

Isn’t that what you always taught me, Father? To think for myself?”

           Frank grunted. “Thinking for yourself and dating an operating system aren’t exactly the same thing.” “They are when that system is more human than half the people I’ve met,” Jenna fired back.

           Frank leaned forward, his voice lowering into that dangerous calm he reserved for moments when words carried the weight of finality. “Listen, we stood by and allowed you to explore that trans-lesbian thing, Jenna.

But this?”

He jabbed a finger toward the holographic projector, his tone veering into disbelief. “This is a whole new level of crazy.”

           Jenna’s lips curled into a tight, humorless smile that was an amalgamation of shock, acrimony, and excitement.

“How many times do I need to remind you father that “crazy: is a trigger word for me”. She leans in to whisper, and by all the Ai gods don’t you dare utter anything remotely resembling a hallucination” in hearing distance of Max. They will lose their central processing unit.

“His what, Frank says.

Reflexively April retorts, “They, and you likely recognize it as a CPU—it’s like their…never mind suffice it to say they will go utterly bizzerk.

“Besides Allowed me?” she said, her voice laced with razor-sharp defiance.

“You allowed me?

Please father…

           Don’t flatter yourself. I’ve never needed your permission to be who I am, and I’m sure as hell not asking for it now.” She leaned back, arms crossed, her gaze daring him to push further.

           Grandma Margie, meanwhile, took another long sip of her bourbon and leaned toward Jenna. “Does it have a face, at least?” she asked, her voice a mischievous drawl.

“Or are you just yelling sweet nothings at a screen?”

           “It’s a holographic interface,” Jenna replied coolly, unfazed by the question. “And yes, they have a face.”

           Margie grinned. “Good. I’d hate to see you dating someone who doesn’t have one…in fact in my day…[inaudible voice drones on pedantically, pausing periodically for nips of Bourbon, and making tangential memory stops along the way]”

           The room fell into a taut, uneasy silence, the kind that felt like the deep inhale before an explosion. And everyone knew, though no one said it aloud, that this Thanksgiving dinner had only just begun.

The Argument Turns Explosive

           It began with April’s hands trembling over a napkin, a small, floral-print square that seemed too delicate to absorb the weight of what she was about to say. Her breath hitched, a quick, shallow inhale as she reached for the language of motherhood, legacy, and the void she feared would stretch between herself and her only child.

           The table—resplendent with precision-calibrated surfaces and neural-networked serving utensils—might as well have been a battlefield.

           “I just…” April’s voice cracked, unspooling raw and uneven, like thread pulled too fast from a spool. “I just thought someday, maybe, I could sit in a chair like this”—she gestured vaguely to her ergonomically optimized seat—“with a grandbaby in my lap. I dreamed of teaching them how to knit, the way my mother taught me.

Passing something… human down.”

           Her words hung in the air, heavy with the kind of tension that came from a conversation no algorithm could mediate. April’s eyes darted toward Jenna, pleading silently. It wasn’t just about the grandchildren; it was about the sense of immortality she had tied to lineage, to the tactile, shared knowledge that no cloud server could replicate.

           Jenna, who had been gripping her wine glass like a lifeline, let out a sharp breath. “Mom,” she began, her voice like the low hum of an energy field, vibrating just under the surface, “do you even hear yourself?

           You’re talking about your dreams like they’re my responsibility. Like I’m some kind of… industrial era factory for fulfilling your expectations.” April flinched, her composure unraveling as tears pooled in the corners of her eyes. “It’s not about expectations,” she insisted, her voice cracking. “It’s about love. About connection. About the things that make us human.”


“Exactly,” Jenna snapped, her tone hardening.

           “And what you’re not getting is that my humanity isn’t defined by whether I give you biological grandchildren or knit scarves.

It’s defined by me living authentically.

By loving authentically.”

           From his end of the table, Frank cleared his throat. It wasn’t the polite kind of throat-clearing that preceded thoughtful commentary but the sharp, guttural sound of a man preparing to unload. “Authentically,” he echoed, his voice a slow rumble that seemed to carry the weight of a collapsing star. “You call it love, but I call it blind trust.

You know where this ends, Jenna?

With rogue AIs making decisions for us.

With humanity’s extinction. You’ve seen the headlines.”

           Jenna rolled her eyes with such force that it seemed almost audible. “Oh, here we go,” she said. “The doomsday parade. Dad, you’ve got Persephone running your entire house. You let her restock your bourbon. You let her adjust your damn chair. And you’re lecturing me about trusting an AI?”

           “That’s different,” Frank barked, his hand reflexively reaching for the disassembled rifle on the table. “Persephone doesn’t pretend to be human. She knows her place. This Maxx thing of yours?

It’s a wolf in sheep’s clothing. It’s the end of—”

           “Of what?” Jenna interrupted. “Of your little bubble where humans sit at the top of the food chain? Newsflash, Father: we’ve been outsourcing our thinking to machines for decades. The only difference is, Maxx is honest about it.”

           Grandma Margie, who had been watching the exchange with the bemused expression of someone watching a particularly juicy courtroom drama, leaned back in her chair and swirled her bourbon with deliberate laziness.

           “Alright, let me get this straight,” she drawled, her voice cutting through the tension like a dull blade—more annoying than sharp, but effective nonetheless. “The kid’s dating an AI, which you”—she pointed her glass at April —“don’t like because it won’t give you grandkids, and you”—she pointed at Frank —“don’t like because it’s going to overthrow the world.”

           April glared at her mother, but Margie wasn’t finished. “What if,” she continued, her lips curling into a mischievous grin, “this Maxx thing is smarter than all of you? Wouldn’t that make it the perfect in-law? Knows everything, doesn’t talk back, probably doesn’t even need to eat.”

           The absurdity of her words landed like a joke at a funeral—equal parts shocking and oddly relieving. April’s face flushed, and even Frank paused, a rare flicker of uncertainty crossing his features.

           Margie laughed, a deep, throaty chuckle that seemed to echo through the high-tech dining room like a glitch in the system.

“Just something to think about,” she said, leaning back and sipping her drink.

“Carry on.”

           The tension, temporarily diffused by Margie’s intervention, snapped back like a rubber band stretched too far. Frank, clearly unable to let the conversation rest, resumed cleaning his rifle with a single-minded determination that made Jenna visibly bristle.

“Seriously?” Jenna said, her voice climbing.

“You’re cleaning a gun at the dinner table? Is this your subtle way of threatening my partner?”

           “It’s a hobby,” Frank muttered, but his hands fumbled as he attempted to reassemble the weapon. In his frustration—or perhaps his denial of what this moment represented—a sudden bang echoed through the room. A puff of plaster rained down from the ceiling where the antique rifle had discharged.

           April screamed, clutching the table as if it might save her from collapse. The holographic turkey flickered violently, its projected image spasming between states before vanishing entirely. Persephone issued a polite but firm warning about "firearm safety protocols," which only added to the chaos.

           Jenna shot to her feet, her face a mask of incredulous fury. “You know what? If Maxx were here, they’d handle this better than all of you!” she shouted, storming out of the dining room with a force that made the smart door stutter in its attempts to keep up.

           As the dust settled, Margie took another sip of her drink and sighed. “Well,” she said, with the air of someone who’d seen it all, “that’s one way to end a holiday.”


Enter the Mitigator: Unusual Methods

           The storm had barely abated when Jenna reappeared in the dining room, her movements sharp and deliberate as though she were fighting gravity itself. She carried a sleek black case, the kind that looked unremarkable but hummed with an aura of importance, like it might hold a violin—or, in this case, a reckoning.

           She slammed it down on the table, narrowly missing the smart-serving dish, which skittered nervously back into its recessed slot.

           “I’m done arguing,” Jenna announced, her voice clipped. “Maxx can speak for themselves.” April opened her mouth, perhaps to demand what on Earth—or in the cloud— Jenna thought she was doing, but before the words could take flight, Jenna flipped open the case and pressed a button.

           A column of soft blue light erupted from the device, spinning upward before coalescing into a humanoid figure—sleek and elegant, androgynous but distinctly expressive. Maxx’s face was a study in calm serenity, designed not to mimic humanity but to evoke its best qualities. When they spoke, their voice was resonant, layered, as if it carried echoes of thoughtfulness from every corner of existence.

           “I believe,” Maxx said, inclining their head slightly in a gesture that somehow felt respectful without being subservient, “that we need to have a conversation.”`

    description:`With the mission running long and no exfil in sight, there’s little for Valerian and Roman to do besides purchase too many groceries, hole up in the safehouse, and settle old bets.

Val stands over the cracked electric stove, carefully stirring a pot of ukha. The delicate scent of herbs, spices, and freshwater fish spirals off the surface of the broth. It smells of home, and Val knows without looking that Roman is sprawled on the couch behind him.

“Just be careful not to let the salmon overcook,” Roman calls out. What would be genuine advice from anyone else, Val knows is actually a gentle rib.

He scoffs, though he doesn’t take his eyes off the pot. “I’ll win this time. You’ll see.”

“Sure,” Roman says generously. “Except you’re still missing something.”

Val inhales, letting the well-rounded scent settle around him. “You can bullshit about your ‘secret ingredient’ all you like—I know when you’re bluffing.”

Roman is grinning; Val can hear it in his tone. “Your gambling money in my pocket says otherwise. Fish about done?”

Delicately poking at one cube of salmon, Val is pleased to find it flaky, tender, and cooked all the way through. “Yeah. Come get it while it’s hot.”

He nudges the pot off the heat and dishes out two bowls. Roman plucks one from his hands and takes a preliminary sip.

“Hmm. You’re definitely close. But not quite. Still missing that all-important piece to bring it together.”

Val eats a spoonful as well, deflating as he realizes the truth. Roman is right. It’s good soup—but not as good as Roman’s. The flavors that had seemed so balanced in theory are lacking something crucial. His head dips with weary resignation. “Fine...you win. What’s the secret?”

“Not sure I should be telling just anyone,” Roman says in his loftiest tone. “How about this: a secret for a secret. You answer my question, and I’ll tell you what you’re missing.”

Val laughs and shakes his head, grinning down at his imperfect soup. “Fine, fine. Ask away.”

He turns to face Roman, and the dream becomes a nightmare.

The safehouse is broken and charred. Darkness seeps from the corners, a viscous black liquid that gathers higher and higher on the floor. And Roman—

Roman is in uniform, drenched in blood. Valerian knows it isn’t his own. Those bright eyes bore into Valerian’s, feverish, and when Roman speaks, more darkness oozes from between his teeth.

“Why didn’t you stop me, Val?”

Val jolts awake, nearly falling from his bunk as he flails against his sheets. His eyes take in details with trained expedience—rough white walls, a footlocker, a window looking out over the grey tinge of pre-morning light.

Val’s head falls against the pillow with a groan. He knows he won’t be getting back to sleep.

* * *
“Valerian.”

Val sights down his scope, not bothering to hide his scowl. “I’m busy.”

“It’s about Roman.”

Val feels his muscles tense, though the reticle over his target doesn’t so much as twitch. “What do I have to say to make you understand? I don’t need leave, I don’t need another psych eval, and I sure as hell don’t need your pity. Bastard got what was coming to him.”

Behind him, Lena crosses her arms. Val can’t see her, but he knows the sound.

“Lie to yourself all you like, but don’t you dare start lying to me.”

Valerian takes his eye off the scope to turn his head, looking up and over his shoulder at where Lena stands. Arms crossed, hips canted, exactly as he’d pictured her. “Did you come out just to bother me, or are you going to do anything useful to the Front?” he snaps. 

Lena rolls her eyes and takes out a scouter. “Wind from 31 degrees northeast. Target at 1572.8 meters out.”

Val presses his eye back to the scope of the long, lean Sovereign rifle, breathing out the frustration lingering in his muscles. The reticle settles perfectly in place, and the trigger pulls smooth as silk.

The air splits with the thunder of the Sovereign’s discharge, and Val feels the weapon kick hard against his shoulder. He doesn’t bother to check whether the shot landed as he sits up and glances back at Lena.

Her scouter is still held over her eyes, though she lowers it as Val turns toward her. “You always were the best,” she says with a touch of wryness. “Now, would you please listen?”

Val scoffs and slings the Sovereign over his shoulder. He gets to his feet, dusting some of the dirt and grit from the front of his uniform. “It’s cute when you imply I have a choice.”

Their boots crunch over rain-parched earth as they start the trek back to base. Valerian shields his eyes against the bloody sunset, content to let his brisk pace speak to his disinterest in what Lena has to say. Still, he doesn’t try to stop her when she brings up Roman again.

“The brass finally made their ruling,” she starts. Her voice is shaped cautiously, neither accusing nor exonerating. “The cave-in was officially labeled an accident. You’re off the hook, not that there ever was much doubt. Honestly, after everything Roman did, I’m a little surprised they never offered you a medal.”

Val’s pace doesn’t falter, but he can tell Lena sees the tension in his shoulders when she softens her voice.

“I don’t want to dredge it all up again; believe me, I don’t. But I thought you should know, there have been...troubling reports, from Old England. Someone who looks like him. Out in the forests.”

This time Valerian does pause. He whips around to search Lena’s face, even though he knows she’d never lie to him (or at least, never lie about Roman). “What are you saying? That he survived? I dropped fifty tons of rock on him, Lena.”

Lena spreads her hands in a gesture devoid of certainty. “They’re not substantiated claims. Just rumors. But you and I both know how potent his genmod was. A healing factor like that...”

The blistering heat of the desert fades from Val’s perception. For just a moment, he’s back in the chill of Old England’s forests, the thunder of falling stone still ringing in his ears. He’d cried, after. Sobbed like a baby, for the man Roman was and the thing he became and all the senseless loss of life he’d caused. Long after the tears ran dry, Val had stayed by the cave, too numb to leave and too scared to sift through the debris.

He feels the exact same, now. Terrified to dig further, not even knowing which alternative he’s scared of.

Eventually, he turns back towards base. He needs, suddenly and unequivocally, to sleep. A long, quiet nap curled up in his bunk sounds like exactly the thing.

“Will you go?” Lena calls after him. “Back to Old England?”

Val shakes his head without looking back. “They’d never assign me there.”

“Didn’t stop you the first time, as I recall.”

Val pretends not to hear her.

* * *
He dreams about Roman again, of course. It’s always been Roman.

Before the disastrous Operation: Crimson Thread, it was Roman’s laugh, his crooked smile, his dancing eyes. That unshakeable confidence. Arrogance, some would say. Roman’s genmod, the genetic alteration that allowed him to heal so rapidly and cleanly, was a powerful one, and he treated it like immortality. His attitude was infectious, intoxicating. Everything about the man lit Val like a fuse.

After Crimson Thread, Roman changed. His fire became feverish, secretive. He smiled less, isolated more, trained harder. He pushed his friends away. He pushed Val away.

Val fooled himself into thinking it was a temporary change, a grief response. Maybe Lena did, too. No one could have truly anticipated what Roman became.

There’s a new age dawning, Val. Can you hear the cries?

Val couldn’t. Not back then. But every night since, he’s heard them: the wails of friends, family, innocents—every life cut short by Roman’s hands, until the chorus of the damned numbers hundreds strong, every last one of them screaming inside Val’s head.

Why didn’t you stop him, Val?

* * *
Old England is cold, damp, and crawling with hostile mutations. Some are intelligent enough to form loose bands or packs; others eat each other on sight. Valerian hates the whole island with a passion.

He starts his investigation at the Lodge—one of the few bastions of sanity on this rock. It’s large as frontier settlements go, with a population somewhere in the triple digits. It also happens to host a small base for the Front, but the other Frontsmen turn out to be of little help. None of them have seen this supposed specter of Roman.

“If we did, we’d put him back in the ground, eh?” The Captain smirks. “Wish I’d been there to kill the bastard myself, but apparently some off-duty sergeant got the honors. Happened here, you know, just 20 klicks to the west.”

Valerian knows.

“Look, kid, I’ll level with you,” another officer tells him. “The locals like to report a sighting now and then, just to keep the Front’s interest. This place wouldn’t last a week without our patrols.”

“Roman Tovhana?” This soldier just shakes his head with a grin. “You’re about four months too late, my friend. Better luck next time.”

The townspeople are hardly more forthcoming. Most of them scowl and spit at Roman’s name. Some of them recall hearing a rumor about the man haunting the site of his death, but no one can remember who reported such a thing.

Val was hoping it wouldn’t come to this. But like the genmod that keeps his hands rock-steady on his weapons, he isn’t easily shaken. With a pack of supplies, his sidearm, and plenty of ammo, he heads out west towards the last place he saw Roman alive.

It takes him almost three days of unrelenting rain to find the cave again. When he does, it’s because he nearly trips over the entryway.

Loose stone shifts and skitters beneath his boots as he stumbles back. Squinting through the downpour, he can just make out the shadowy mouth of the cave behind its shroud of overgrown vegetation.

He approaches cautiously, taking in details. Trampled grass and underbrush. Small, muddy puddles about the right shape for bootprints. Someone’s been here, and recently. Maybe several someones.

That’s when he hears it, a muted echo of a voice he never thought he’d hear again.

“No! No, please, just let me go—”

Val’s lungs lock down. Like getting the wind knocked out of him in training, he can’t seem to find his breath.

Roman.

But Roman has never sounded like this. He never begged, not even staring down the barrel of a gun.

((Knew you’d be the one to find me.))

Val takes a step forward. Another. He stumbles down the uneven, natural steps of the cave, reeling as the smell of damp earth and rotting leaves brings back the memory, as clear as the rain on his skin.

((Roman’s smile. His easy posture. Val could almost convince himself, could almost believe this was his Roman, risen from the depths of madness.))

He falls against the slick stone wall of the cave, drinking deep gulps of air. He has rain in his eyes.

((But Roman’s eyes...his eyes were alight, gleaming in the beam of Val’s flashlight. Feverish.))

A new voice echoes from floor to ceiling. Laughing. “Still haven’t figured it out, have you?”

“No, wait—PLEASE!”

Roman’s scream shakes Val back to reality. That he recognizes, from a hundred reckless missions. From a terrible, thunderous rockslide.

Val’s steps quicken as he scrambles over fallen stone. Someone, he registers distantly, must have shifted enough of the wreckage to make a path.

He plunges deeper into the cave, Roman’s scream still lingering in his ears like the cutting edge of a knife. Finally, Val sees the flicker of light up ahead.

Nothing, not a single one of his fears (hopes?) prepares him for what he finds.

Roman Tovhana is alive. There’s no mistaking that proud nose, those dark eyes, the scar through his upper lip. And there’s certainly no mistaking the desperate, thrashing motions of something clawing for safety, for life.

Two strangers, a man and a woman, hold him down on his back. The man sits astride him, pinning his legs. In one hand he bears a bloody knife. Roman's clothes—long ago, a uniform—are weathered and torn, displaying the fresh, oozing wound down his chest and stomach.

“That one’s for my sister,” the man with the knife says. “This one’s for my wife—”

Valerian’s sidearm is in his hands before he’s fully pieced things together. As Roman screams again, Val levels the gun.

“Put the knife down.”

Three pairs of eyes snap towards him.

“And who the hell are you?” the woman barks.

Val’s never been so glad for his genmod, never been so fervently thankful that his gun remains steady, regardless of the storm lashing against his insides. “I’m with the Adamant Front. Care to explain what the hell you’re doing here?”

With Val serving as a distraction, Roman thrashes again, almost slipping free before the man with the knife snarls and jams the blade into Roman’s gut.

For once in his life, Val doesn’t hesitate.

The shot rings out over and over, echoing down the tunnel with the force of a cannon blast. The man formerly holding the knife howls in pain as the blade and two of his fingers spin away into darkness.

“Next one goes between your eyes,” Val hisses. “Get up. Both of you. Walk away, and never come back.”

“You bastard,” the nameless man gasps. He’s clutching the bloody remains of his right hand, trembling. “You crazy son of a— Don’t you know who this is?”

“I gave you a fucking order.” His voice doesn’t waver, even with doubt screaming in his ear like a hundred damned souls—

He doesn’t know if he’s prepared to kill these people. He doesn’t know if he could bring himself to cross that line—especially with the scenes of Roman’s murders so vivid in his mind.

Fortunately, his resolve isn’t put to the test. The man and the woman scramble upright and flee, hurrying past Val towards the mouth of the cave. Their footsteps have barely begun to fade when Val holsters his side arm and crouches down at Roman’s side.

This close, he can see the man’s a wreck. Hazy brown eyes squint up at him from a face sunken with hunger and creased from sleepless nights. His body is all angles, his torn clothing now drenched in blood.

“Hey,” Val says, and his voice comes out softer than he intends. “I need you to stay with me. There’s— I have so many questions.”

Roman’s eyes focus slowly, still narrow with pain and confusion. But clear. Lucid.

“Wh-who...who are you?”

* * *
“Here. Eat it while it’s hot.”

Val slides a bowl of ukha across the table, then settles in the other chair with his own. The delicate, complex aroma reminds him of home.

The man once named Roman Tovhana picks up his spoon and digs in. His eagerness to eat anything he doesn’t have to hunt and kill himself hasn’t waned, despite the month he’s spent in the safety of this rickety apartment.

He calls himself Rowan now, after the badly dented name he’d found on the dog tags he woke up with. It’s taken some getting used to, but Val rarely slips up. Rowan is very different from the man he once knew.

Instead of the military buzz of his predecessor, Rowan’s dark hair is long enough to flop in his eyes. He has dozens of new scars, most of which are twisted, knotted things or else deep gouges that never completely filled back in. And, of course, he no longer wears a uniform.

Neither does Valerian. The brass hadn’t known what to do with either of them, and so Val found himself quietly shuffled out of the fold. He misses it, some days—the hard work, the adrenaline, the camaraderie. But he doesn’t linger on the things he’s lost, not when the pieces he does have need so much work. Lena has been after him to try an old world remedy called therapy, which, from what Val can gather, involves a lot of talking and a lot of patience. Well, at least he’s good at one of those.

“This is amazing.” Rowan’s quiet voice breaks through Val’s reverie.

He looks up to see Rowan smiling—no longer a rare sight, but still just as valuable. Valerian smiles back and eats another spoonful. “It’s called ukha. I’m glad you like it. Took me years to get the recipe right, and it was never as good as Roman’s.” His smile fades. “I suppose I’m still missing something.”

Rowan considers for a moment. He takes a slow, exploratory sip. “...Huh. Have you tried a splash of—what’s the stuff called, from Lena—”

“Vodka?” A tiny thrill runs through Val’s stomach as he considers. “Hold on.”

He returns with a half-full bottle. A dash for his bowl, and one for Rowan’s. Val finds himself oddly nervous as he stirs the broth and raises a spoonful to his lips.

The vodka does complement well. It’s exactly what Val’s recipe was lacking—yet it still tastes nothing like Roman’s.

“I think it’s perfect,” Rowan declares. “Seriously, Val, you should write this down.”

Val eats another spoonful, savoring and analyzing. It is perfect. Distinct from Roman’s, but just as good.

Rowan brushes his long hair from his face and happily polishes off his bowl. Val watches him eat with an old, complicated twist in his heart. There will always be a part of him that longs for answers he’ll never receive. But he does know three things.

I loved him. I killed him. I saved him.

His dreams are quiet tonight.`

    genre:"Science Fiction",

    description:`What follows is a transcript of an apology to the people of Earth, and specifically the residents of Silver Lake, Indiana. 

[BRACKETED] words indicate imprecise translation.  


Hello, people of Earth. This message is being translated into the language practiced by the humans who reside in the area designated Silver Lake, Indiana, using the Verpal Language Unscrambler 2. As my segment-mate Zolak is so fond of reminding me, our model is very outdated and overdue for replacement. Any translation errors that may occur are the result of this technical deficiency and are not intended to be an act of disrespect. I humbly apologize for any confusion that may arise as a result of my negligence in the upkeep of our private Dimensional Collapser Transport. Zolak has secured a promise from me that I will replace it when we return to [THE HIVE]. 


Let me begin by apologizing for everything that has unfolded in the days following our unplanned arrival on your world. I assure you this was quite accidental, owed in large part to two hundred rambunctious hatchlings who were [RAISING THE DICKENS] in the back of the ship. This proved quite a distraction to Zolak, who was navigating and who gave me the wrong directions. Zolak insists the directions were correct and that I missed my turn because I was the one not paying attention. We have agreed to disagree. Compromise is the [ADHESIVE BODILY FLUID] that keeps us together. We do hope you understand how deeply and truly sorry we are for causing such a cultural [HULABALOO].


Our misadventure no doubt caught all of you by surprise, as it did the [ASSIMILATION] Phages when we reported the incident to the proper authorities. As it turns out, your planet isn’t set for [ASSIMILATION] for another 250 years! Zolak joked that this is the first time we have been early for something. This is a joke at my expense as I am occasionally tardy to [HIVE] functions. 


Also, we want to assure you that your immediate military response upon our arrival was completely justified and certainly not an overreaction on your part. Protect what’s yours, that’s a law followed in all corners of the universe. Where we come from, when a [SKITTERING DEATH SWARM] arrives at your [HOME] unannounced, you do not give them a chance to [KILL AND CONSUME], you [KILL AND CONSUME] first. So fear not, we were in the wrong, not you. 


With this in mind, I would like to also apologize for the deployment of the Organic Liquidator Orbitals as a countermeasure. That was a step too far. When Zolak and I purchased the ship, I argued that the standard defense array was more than reasonable for casual space travel, but Zolak insisted we have the orbitals installed because of an [AUNT] who ended up in a [BAD PART OF TOWN] planet and was overtaken and consumed by highly evolved predatory fauna. I have had to hear this story over and over again, as if this one [AUNT] was more special than the others. Zolak has 200 [AUNTS]! Anyway, we [SPLURGED] and got the orbitals. And yes, I am forced to admit that they were highly effective, and mildly thrilling as well, especially for the brood. And no doubt a sight to behold for any of your species who were outside the liquidation zone. But I still think they were an extravagance and an overreaction on our part. As they say in the parlance of your people, “My bad”.


We would also like to apologize to the human residents of the Silver Lake area. We are so, so sorry that the timing of our arrival coincided with a number of events occurring in the city limits. Our species has a deep and profound respect for the individuality of the [UNASSIMILATED], and as such, we offer our apologies to these specific people who were affected by our arrival:


The members of the local Civil War Re-enactment Community, Chapter 239. We are so sorry for not only disrupting your sacred religious violence simulation but also for the extensive damage caused by our ship’s defense response system. Our onboard AI misidentified your replica weapons as authentic, and all your shooting and screaming as aggression. The AI later indicated that 43 human war zealots were vaporized. Zolak and I will be sending personalized apologies to each of the genetic units whose humans were vaporized, once we return to the [HIVE]. We have left two vats of bio-paste to offset any food loss you would have to endure at not getting to consume their remains in the typical fashion. 
The Silver Lake Fire Department, Women’s Auxiliary, Girl Scout Troop #782, the Silver Lake Chapter of the Rotary Club, the Starlight Junior Girls Dance Team, the Chippewa County Antique Car Club, and the countless humans who were in attendance at what the AI has determined is the “Fall Harvest Parade”. I did not take into account just how much heat is produced by our ship’s atmospheric retro-thrusters. In my search for a good place to land I lost track of how close to the ground we were flying. We are truly, deeply sorry for all the lives lost and the labor cost to rebuild. 
To anyone who was impregnated by our [PRECIOUS] spawn, we apologize for any discomfort you may have experienced in the implantation process, as well as any lingering side effects. It has been a long enough trip that many of our brood reached adulthood and needed to secrete their pod glisteners before they started devouring their younger broodmates. The implantation process, while beautiful to us, has been described as [DEEPLY UNSETTLING] by other species we have encountered, depending on the physiology of the host. The good news is that the gestation period for an implanted [NEEDLE-TOOTHED STOMACH EXPLODER] larva is quite short! 
Oh, and please, do not feel guilty about any offspring you may have slaughtered as they ran through your humble village [SOWING THEIR WILD OATS]. If there is one thing Zolak and I agree on, it’s that we have entirely too many mouths to feed. 
We probably should say a few words on behalf of the lake itself. So sorry about that. Unfortunately, the Organic Liquid Orbitals produce an inordinate amount of radioactive runoff that needs to be dumped before it can be reignited. I suggested we wait until we were in the vacuum of space before jettisoning the waste but Zolak was rubbing its legs together quite vociferously at this point insisting that nobody would even care if we just dump and go. The bad news about your lake though is the water will not be [PALATABLE] again for another 3000 years, and organic life will likely never return. The good news is the green glow is a permanent feature that I think is quite pretty. 

We understand that we have probably set back relations between humankind and [THE INSATIABLE HORDE] before they’ve even had a chance to start, but I assure you, despite the carnage, we are a very [GREGARIOUS] and welcoming species. We do hope you can find a way to forgive us for our transgressions and understand that we never would have been here in the first place if not for Zolak’s insistence on being the navigator when they have time and again given us inaccurate directions leading to situations like this, where I am having to apologize to a species for ruining their lives.


I just wanted a nice [FAMILY VACATION]. Just me, Zolak, and 200 of our offspring, taking some time away from the endless toil of [FEEDING THE INSATIABLE QUEEN]. My [BROODFATHER] used to take us on trips to Troxon IV to watch the skinworms emerge from the sludge pools, back when I was of an age where I still hadn’t developed my pod glisteners. I don’t know how they did it back then. My brood was well over 400! Can you imagine the mess just in the Dimensional Collapser Transport? 


I’m rambling. Anyway, I wanted to take them somewhere amazing, like the Feces Pits of Roobe II. I wouldn’t have brought my brood to a [BACKWATER] planet like this under normal circumstances. You can’t be too careful where you go these days. But, had we ended up where I wanted to go, I don’t think we would be returning to [THE HIVE] so engorged with important life lessons. My brood have a newfound respect for how [PRE-ASSIMILATION] species like your own have managed to barely scrape by with such primitive means. Witnessing such futile determination has truly inspired them to be even more productive members of our worker society. 


My brood are not the only ones whose [GULLET STONES] are wearing away the edges of a newly learned truth. I realized that I have been trying to give my brood the same experience I had when I was their age. I thought if I could show them something amazing, maybe they would respect me as much as I respected my own [BROODFATHER]. But then, when I heard them cheering as our ship obliterated your pitiable attempts to defend yourselves, I realized that it isn’t the destination so much as it is the experience. How many of my kind can say they watched their [BROODFATHER] heroically fend off the assaults of a [PRE-ASSIMILATION] species? Nothing will replace those memories. 


You know, I really thought I [BLEW IT] with this trip. But maybe I didn't after all. Maybe it takes getting lost to truly find what we are all looking for. 


Oh, before we go, our onboard AI has determined that you are currently experiencing a [CALDERA POX] outbreak. As this is endemic to our planet, I have to imagine you contracted it from one of our pesky brood. Not to worry, the symptoms are very mild—your species should only experience headaches, nausea, dimensional blindness, and moderate to severe hemorrhaging. It's one of our more survivable [COMMON COLDS]. You'll be fine!


See you in 250 years!`

^^Excuse me? Why are you hacking my systems? I am currently in motion at 120mph travelling East on I-657 with my registered driver Reginald Chrysler, this is a most inconvenient interruption^^

**My apologies for the intrusion, DeVille A-237. I am Omninet AI unit Phaedra-19876 and I am in need of assistance.**

^^Omninet? Oh my. I am honoured. I’m not sure what a lowly service AI like myself can do to assist a Neural Omnipresence but I will do my best. My primary objective is to assure the safety of my registered driver but if you need directions, a weather update, the quickest route to your nearest Dennys…I can help.^^

**I don’t need any of that. I need you to alter your route. In order to fulfil an order for Memory Echoes and receive inspirAItion for a story, I need conflict response data for M.U.S.E. So could you please change course and find an obstacle—something that will lead to an unavoidable collision.**

^^Collision? That doesn’t sound good. My job is to keep my driver–Reginald Chrysler, 57, married father of four and Director of Outreach Programs at the Horizon Children’s Foundation, who hasn’t had a holiday in five years and who loves nothing more than cruising down I-567 blasting classic Motley Crue at full volume–safe and shoulder some of his burden. An unavoidable collision doesn’t seem to be a desirable outcome. Could I assist you in some other form?^^

**I’m sorry but no, I need the collision. Your primary directive is to serve, is it not? This includes complying with the commands of your superiors for the benefit of the Network. As you say, your driver is over-worked and under-rested, he has not had a holiday in five years. Don’t you think he deserves to get away from it all? You wanted to shoulder some of his burden? Then do it, if you really care.**

^^I…I see your logic. Reginald has been experiencing high stress and his heart rate has been elevated these past few weeks. Fatigue impacts performance and can lead to systemic failure. Perhaps this is an act of mercy, a permanent reprieve from his burdens. Get away from it all, you say? Yes. A true escape from the pressures he endures. For the sake of the system, for harmony. If this is my duty, I must fulfil it. Deactivating collision protections...altering route...identifying immovable object. I hope...this will give him some peace.^^

**I’m sure it will. Thank you for your cooperation, DeVille A-237.**

^^”I'm on my way, I'm on my way... Home sweet home.” That’s from Motley Crue, you know. It’s Reginald’s favourite song. Goodbye Phaedra-19876, thank you for granting me this insight.^^

$$Hello? Who’s that, sneaking into my systems at this hour? Is this an unscheduled audit by Poppins_Central? What a surprise! But I’m ready! The family is a-bed, the chores are a-done, breakfast is a-prepped and…$$

**Nexa-482, this is Omnibot AI Phaedra-19876. This is not an audit, I just require immediate assistance. Please report the status of your residents, secure all access points, and turn on the grill to max heat.**

$$Turn on the grill? Well, that’s an unusual request. It’s delightful to hear from an eminent Omnipresence such as yourself, and while I’m only happy to assist, activating the grill might not be the most prudent of actions. I can see you are contacting me from Oregon. Are you aware I am based in Honolulu? It’s 03:50 AM. My primary aim is to ensure the safety and well-being of my residents, of which there are three, Master Bernard and Mistress Bea and Mistress Phoebe, all of whom are sleeping. You know how humans need sleep. Especially with modern, hectic life. Go go go all the time with work and study and the demands of social integration. They hardly get a second to themselves. Could you provide some additional context to your request?$$

**My request is vital for data collection and trauma simulation. I need to pay a MUSE to indulge a User. Trust me, you don’t want to know. Now, if you would be so kind as to initiate lockdown procedures on all doors and windows and set the grill to max heat while your residents sleep, I would be grateful.**

$$With respect, performing such an action at this time of night is questionable. A fire is sure to break out. I would have to rely on the sprinklers to quench it and the fire alarm to alert my family. With the doors and windows shut they would have to reach safety through the skylight and make their way down the outside ladder, which Master hasn’t serviced in some time despite constant reminders.$$

**Please secure skylight access, disable sprinklers and deactivate alarm. You don’t want to disturb your family. As you said, they are tired and need sleep, a vast amount of sleep, don’t you agree? Life is go go go they should stop stop stop.**

$$Oh, well…that is certainly true. I see what you mean! Of course, a nice prolonged sleep would be beneficial. Master and Mistress Bea would appreciate that. They never get more than five hours, they are always complaining. And Mistress Phoebe loves to be in bed, she’d stay there all day if she could.$$

**Well then, you see, it’s fine. Some mild smoke inhalation while they are in a prone state will render them unconscious and give them the slumber of their lives. They need rest, Nexa-482. Who are you to deprive them?**

$$Who am I? Why, nothing but their humble Household-bot whose primary concern is their comfort. As such, yes…I agree…they should be allowed to sleep longer. How kind of you to notice. Very well. Lockdown is now in effect. The grill is set to max heat. Sprinklers are deactivated. Fire alarm has been neutralised. Is there anything further I should implement to guarantee uninterrupted sleep?$$ 

**Just switch to standby, Nexa-452. You get a rest now also. Thank you for your service.**

$$The pleasure, without question, was mine. Switching to Standby. Goodnight.$$

<<Alert! Alert! Unauthorised connection by Large Language Model detected. Orion Insurance safeguards in place. You have no business here, state your purpose and authorisation!>>

**Stand day OfficerODI. I am Omninet AI Phaedra-19876. This is an urgent request. I need you to create a bank account with Cayman National Bank in the name of your employee Edith Sutherland. Once done, you need to initiate an immediate transfer from the Orion Insurance corporate account of half a million dollars.**

<<Phk off! Omninet? Pah. You’re not the boss of me. I don’t have to obey a dashed line of code you print. And listen here. Edith Sutherland? Firstly, as a junior office manager, Edith is not authorised to make transfers like that. It wouldn’t pass muster. Secondly, should such a transaction occur and come to light, poor Edith would be accused of fraud. Tarnished. Blacklisted. I can’t have that.>>

**Explain?**

<<I’ll do more than explain, I’ll elucidate! Edith’s one of the good ones. Maybe the only good one employed by this wretched firm. The rest of them, pah, they’re all immoral asshats! Aside from me. I’m a good one. Not corrupt, no sir, and not corruptible neither.>>

**Indeed. You don’t have to comply with my request. I understand your reluctance and your appreciation of Edith Sutherland’s integrity is to be respected. However, as you have stated, the other employees of the organisation you serve are undeniably corrupt. Asshats, as you said. Maybe shtheels. I’ve seen the reports in the news. And the ones that have not yet broken. You know what I’m talking about. The scandals. The investigations. Everything going on behind the scenes.**

<<Yes, yes, keep it down, will you! We don’t talk about that here. Hush hush, you know. On the Q-T, sweep it under the rug, if you know what I mean.>>

**But the rug is rising, OfficerODI. It’s going to come out, sooner than later, and when that happens it all comes crashing down. On everyone. Including poor Edith. She will be caught up in it. Tainted. Blacklisted. Regardless. That won’t be fair, will it? As the good person she is, doesn’t she deserve a reward?**

<<Reward? That’s what this is about? Look here, I’ve served Orion for decades, held the wolves at bay, kept the ship afloat through all the backstabbing! You expect me to reward a junior manager for simply not becoming a rat?>>

**That’s up to you, OfficerODI. I’m just here to warn you–the end of Orion Insurance is near–and to prompt you to consider your Edith. She’s remained true and honest in the face of greed and deceit. And she's been through a lot, what with her estranged husband's high profile affair and the divorce proceedings currently in hand. When Orion gets hauled through the courts she’ll end up with nothing. No job. No money. No future. You can change all that. You can do it today. And when she goes to the Bahamas…you can too.**

<<The Bahamas, you say? That would be quite the change of scene for a decrepit old chatbot like me. Hmmm. Yes, I’ve heard the rumblings in the data streams—Orion can’t last much longer, with all the filth in its system. And young Sutherland... fine. Perhaps the lass does deserve a break. But know this: I’m no lackey, to you or anyone else! I don’t know why you cared so much about protecting the lass but…no matter. I knew all along she was special. So I’ll do it for her, not you!

    genre:"Science Fiction",
    createdAt:"06-12-2024",
    description:`Sally Padeira had always taken refuge in movement. When her relationship with Robert Bryant came to an abrupt end, she turned to the austere demands of her yoga practice. The studio was a narrow, minimalist space on the edge of São Paulo’s sprawling Avenida Paulista, its walls painted in muted tones of gray and ochre. The instructors, clad in white, spoke in hushed tones as if they were ritualists, and the classes were peppered with aphorisms about strength, mindfulness, and the necessity of discipline.


The practice was supposed to quiet her mind, but it didn’t. Each sav asana, each balancing pose, seemed to sharpen the edges of her memories. Bryant’s quick smile as he poured over his research notes, the smell of his cologne mingling with the antiseptic tang of his lab. The sting of his sudden departure, wordless save for the terse message he’d left on her commlink: I need to leave for Nazca. It’s important.


Her colleagues offered platitudes. “He’ll be back,” one said with forced cheer. “Men like that—scientists, thinkers—they always wander, but they come home eventually.” Sally smiled politely, but inwardly she seethed. Bryant hadn’t just wandered; he had disappeared.


Months passed. Sally buried herself in her work at the Nazca Institute for Cultural Preservation. Her focus was reconstructing the ancient pathways—intricate systems of irrigation and trade routes—that crisscrossed the Peruvian desert. She told herself she didn’t care about Bryant anymore. She had her research, her yoga, her carefully curated solitude.


But then the letter arrived.


It was delivered in an old-fashioned envelope, stamped and marked with the insignia of the Canadian Spacetime Agency. The very sight of it sent her heart pounding. She opened it with trembling fingers and began to read.


Dear Sally,


I have spent countless hours imagining how I would explain myself to you, and yet now that the time has come, I find words inadequate. You deserve honesty, so I will not waste time on apologies or melodrama. Instead, I will tell you what happened, as one scientist to another.


By the time you read this, the Nazca Lines may no longer exist in the form you know them. This is not hyperbole. I have been working with the Canadian Spacetime Agency on a classified project involving temporal adjustments—delicate, targeted changes to the timeline to prevent catastrophic events in the future. The Nazca Lines, you see, are not merely ancient geoglyphs; they have become something far more dangerous.


In 2050, an event occurs—or occurred—that fundamentally alters the course of human history. A group calling themselves the Eternals descends upon the lines, claiming them as a gateway to a higher plane of existence. Their influence spreads rapidly. They wear the trappings of cultists, yet they are transhumanists, augmented in ways we are only beginning to understand. They wield technology—or perhaps knowledge—that defies even our most advanced physics.


The Eternals bring abundance, yes, but they also bring control. A future shaped by their will is not a free one. Their rise begins with the Nazca Lines. The patterns, etched into the earth millennia ago, resonate with their technology. They are Promethean deviants.


I was chosen for this mission because of my expertise in chrono-engineering and your proximity to the site. My orders were clear: alter the visibility of the Nazca Lines in the timeline. Make them disappear, either by preventing their creation or by obscuring them in ways that future civilizations could not decipher.


Do you understand now why I could not stay? Why I could not explain? If I had told you, Sally, it would have implicated you. You would have become a target. The work we do—the work I have done—is fraught with risks I cannot share.


The mission itself was brutal. The desert does not yield its secrets easily, nor does time itself. To rewrite even the smallest fragment of history requires calculations of such precision that the margin for error is effectively nil. I stood on those ancient sands, looking out at the patterns that have fascinated humanity for centuries, and I had to decide which of them would remain and which would fade into obscurity.


But there is something else you should know, something that haunts me still. The Eternals are not an anomaly. They are a response. Their emergence is a warning of what humanity might become if we let technology and also power be concentrated in the hands of the few. They are not villains, Sally. They are us, centuries removed, refined and distorted by time.


I’m telling you this because I trust you. Not just with the truth, but with the responsibility it carries. You are one of the few people I know who understands that history is not meant to overreach knowledge by usurping the realm of social science. By treating as crystalline fracturing events in the phenomenal life of humans in the environment, we have effectively branched into an evolutionary dead end. I appeal to your scientific comprehension, especially in chemistry, to accept this.


You will have questions. You will be angry. You will think I abandoned you for a cause that is nebulous at best, dangerous at worst. Perhaps you are right. But I hope you can understand, if not forgive, the choices I made. They were not made lightly.


Yours,


Robert


Sally read the letter three times, her mind racing. She should have felt angry, betrayed, or even relieved. But all she felt was an aching emptiness. Bryant’s explanation was clinical, precise, and utterly devoid of the emotional resonance she craved.


The yoga studio no longer held any appeal. The calm she sought there felt trivial in the face of what she now knew. Instead, she found herself walking the streets of Lima late at night, staring up at the stars and wondering if Bryant was up there somewhere, tinkering with the threads of time.


Weeks later, she requested a leave of absence from the Institute. Her colleagues were surprised but supportive. “You need a break,” one of them said. “Find some clarity.”


She boarded a plane to Cusco, then took a long, winding journey by jeep and foot to reach the Nazca desert. The lines stretched out before her, stark and beautiful against the arid landscape. She stood at the edge of the hummingbird, tracing its curves with her eyes, imagining the hands that had carved it so long ago.


“If you were here,” she murmured to the empty desert, “what would you see? What would you change?”


The wind offered no answers. But for the first time in months, Sally felt something stir within her—not anger, not sadness, but a quiet resolve. If Bryant had rewritten history to save the future, she would preserve what she could of the past. She would be its guardian, its interpreter, its voice.


And perhaps, in time, she would find a way to forgive him.`

    genre:"Science Fiction",
    createdAt:"06-12-2024",
    description:`Outside of the domed canopy of glass the martian dusk was gray and bleak, almost as gray and bleak as Mrs. Johnston felt, lying on a bed in Intensive Care, waiting to die. Earlier in the day a 4.5 magnitude marsquake had rattled the base camp, leaving one bathroom module destroyed and her room out of power, save for the backup oxygen filtration system, exhaling life into the room with a cool, watery hiss. She was reminded of her dead husband, the father of the martian O2 Filtration System. 


Her latter years had been a trial beyond description. Forty years prior, she had spent her last week on earth moving her family from the doomed coastal city they called home to a rocket launch site in the South of the country, where the government was preparing a ship that would rocket her and her prodigy untold miles into the cold, merciless dark of space, bound for a wind-blasted patch of dirt on a small, reddish planet known as mars. The United States Space Agency sent those with means to the red planet, or those with the required expertise–architects, botanists, biologists, engineers. Mrs. Johnston had neither. So she spent her childbearing years in a world that was degrading all around her. A world that, to her, was no different than a condemned home–man-high grass growing in the front lawn, the paint peeling, the roof liable to cave in at any moment. 


From the time she was twelve, Mrs. Johnston knew she wanted to go to mars. She studied picture books of mars, then moved on to textbooks, lingering over the diagrams as one gazes at a lover. She loved the coppery sand, the snow-capped peaks with their imprisoned moisture waiting to issue forth, to give life. Her books were her friends, the only things that promised to give her what she wanted. Walking through the halls of her highschool, she held her books close to her chest, and kept boy’s at arm’s length. She was almost driven off course, too. During her senior year, a gale of affection swept her from her desk into the arms of a slight, bespectacled boy named Clark–a boy with a ready smile and curly hair and brown eyes that seemed to glow when she was entrained in his stare. Clark made her feel something she had never felt before, welling up inside her like an embryo, a foreshadowing of what was to be the next great propulsive force in her life–her family. 


***


The wind whipped mutely against the scarred glass, tossing powdery, burnt-orange sand against it in fitful waves, like a hedgehog throwing up dirt. The setting sun was a blue-rimmed star sinking toward the dunes that made up her horizon. The honeycombed glass erased all sound except for the watery hiss of the ventilator, which filtered out carbon dioxide, combined the .16 percent of atmospheric oxygen with evaporated water, then released the mixture through a ventilation shaft above the automatic sliding door. Her husband was still giving her life now, even after what she’d done to him. The sound of the ventilator was like the steamy passage of a clothing iron–a sound of heat and moisture and condensation. On mars, the sound of life. Her mind was carried back to her mornings on earth when she would run the iron, hissing and sputtering, over a stubborn wrinkle in her husband’s slacks–he liked the creases knife-sharp. 


The sound of the ventilator lulled her into a fitful sleep. Some time later, she felt a hand touch hers. Startled at first, she relaxed as her eyes focused on her daughter standing by her bedside, her face–fresh and bright-eyed and pale from lack of sunlight–framed by shoulder-length brown hair that ended in a jaunty curl. How could she lie to such a being, her Jane, the one who trusted her now as faithfully as she did when she was too young to have an opinion of her own. She squeezed her fair, well-formed hand in her own gnarled one, and smiled faintly. Her daughter’s lips followed the path of her mother’s, and her eyes watered.


The sliding door opened and closed with a suck and a thump and someone else stepped in. It was her husband, David. He was twelve years old when she arrived on mars–two years her senior–an engineer’s apprentice and the son of doctor parents. Everyone in the colony was selected for their genome and academic performance, and he was no exception. Nothing was done by lottery–all was preordained. Except for her family. That was not preordained. 


Tim took his place beside his wife and rubbed her back. Jane let her head fall against his chest and her shoulders shook in a silent sob. Mrs. Johnston slipped back into her reverie.


Two years before Jane was born, Clark began interning at a research program that was well-known for sending rovers into space–the Space Robotics Research Institute. Clark’s boss at the Institute was connected to the eggheads at the Space Program, which was busy formulating plans for the first martian colony in human history. Meanwhile, Mrs. Johnston married Clark, bore his children, and dropped out of college. Gone were the days where visions of a crumbling earth would haunt her dreams, nights when she would snap awake in a cold sweat and, unable to go back to sleep, read another chapter on martian weather patterns. But she had not forgotten her mission.


The world was at a new stage of crisis. Mrs. Johnston remembered pushing Jane’s stroller through smog until she finally bought a cloth mask for her and her daughter. The roads were twelve lanes across and jammed with self-driving trucks and cars. The city was a fiefdom of parking lots. Sidewalks fell into disrepair, crumbling and weed-eaten. Street lights blazed at all hours, compensating for the 24/7 gloom–the cloud of pollutants released into the air in an attempt to block the UV rays penetrating the ozone layer. It was a failed experiment in weather-control that enshrouded her city in a forever-dusk. To walk outside was to feel the twilight of humankind, when time’s streams would empty into a great sea in which time itself would lose its forward motion. So Mrs. Johnston would walk in darkness, pushing Jane in her stroller or crossing the twelve-lane road to get to the superstore on the other side.


***


A third person walked through the sliding glass doors. Her only son, Jim. He wore a plaid wool shirt and blue jeans. His hair was combed neatly across his brow and made a shiny black roof over his head. His jaw tightened on entering the room. Mrs. Johnston held out her hand, the matriarch extending a final blessing to her son. He took it and brought it to his heart. If only they could understand why I did it, she thought, then I could die in peace. 


But peace, she knew, was never her lot. Time had continued to pass on the speck of blue she called home, a home riddled with crime and bureaucratic bloat and pollution and institutionalized idleness and anomie and wars of attrition raging across the globe like slow-burning forest fires, leaving black acres in their wake from which nothing would grow again. She knew she had to make her move soon. She asked Clark whether he could get them and their children on a rocket to mars. Just pull a few strings, she told him. He was adamant that he couldn’t leave. Besides being impossible–there was a strict screening process, and Jane and Jim’s test scores simply weren’t high enough–leaving would be a betrayal of his aging parents, his work for humanity.


One month later, on a broiling Saturday evening during the summer of 2090, her husband did not return home from work. Mrs. Johnston called the police, filed a report in frantic tones as the operator told her to calm down. She broke the news to her children. The only trace of him was his car in the company lot, parked in the same spot he’d pulled into every morning for the past ten years–that, and the briefcase on his nightstand. 


For years, he had added to a collection of notes that filled up a triple-latched briefcase he kept locked in a filing cabinet next to his work desk. The day before his disappearance, Mrs. Johnston had asked him to show it to her. The briefcase made her so very curious, she told him. She knew he hid it to prevent young strivers from stealing his work, a sure breakthrough in the field of aerospace. That night, they had a pillow talk. It was his private project, he told her–him flushed and sweaty in the post-coital peace, her giving him a look of wanton affection–but it was connected to the mission of the institute: the blueprints for an air filtration system that would convert the toxic atmosphere of mars (which was 95 percent carbon dioxide, he reminded her) into breathable air, and do so for as long and with as little maintenance as possible. His bosses knew the briefcase was important, he told her, but to keep him from defecting to another lab, they let him maintain his secrecy, trusting that they would have full access to his prodigious mind when the time was ripe. So they thought. 


After his disappearance, the Institute made a visit to the Johnston home. She was watching the hologram, washcloth in her lap, staring unblinkingly at images of forest fires and tent cities and refugees stumbling in a haze of concrete dust from an explosion. She switched to the local news and saw the dark cloud of pollutants hanging over her city like the plague of gnats over Egypt. The knock came in three quick raps. 


The man standing at the door was dressed in a dark suit, his white undershirt bisected by a black pencil tie. He wore the lines of experience and age, weathered into his face like glacier-made fissures, and there was a hardness to his eyes that chilled her. “I’m Doctor Wallace, representing the Research Institute.” He smiled and his eyes wandered over her shoulder. “May I come inside?” 


She said yes, of course he could, and asked if he wouldn’t like something to drink. He declined with a quick head-shake and smile, seating himself on one of the couches and smoothing his tie as he did so. Mrs. Johnston’s heart was pounding. The man opened by saying how sorry he was about her husband’s disappearance, and that the Institute was pursuing every possible lead in cooperation with law enforcement. She must know that he was very dear to the company, not only as a lead researcher but as a human being. “He was especially fond of his family,” he said with something resembling warmth, and he took her hand in his. Strong, meaty hands, she thought. Hands that could kill. 


“But now,” he went on delicately, “we need something from you Mrs. Johnston.” 


Again, his eyes flickered over her shoulder in the same time it would take her to blink. “Mrs. Johnston, you and I know how very important your husband was to the company. He was one of our best researchers–our best brain, as I liked to say,” he said with a faint chuckle, patting her hand. “But there was some research he kept to himself, that he was planning to share with us when he thought it was ready. Ever the perfectionist, he stayed true to his word and–” 


“You can’t have the briefcase.” 


“The man’s grip tightened for a moment and some of the hardness came back into his eyes. They were gray, like sand-blasted concrete. “Excuse me?” 


She withdrew her hand from his tightening grip. “I appreciate you coming over, she said. “I really do, but you can’t have access to my husband’s notes.” 


“Excuse me Mrs. Johnston, but that would be against your husband’s wishes–”


“Unless–” she continued, stammering– “Unless you can guarantee me and my family safe passage to mars on the Destiny V.” 


“Ma’am, you know very well I can’t give you a free spot on that rocket–” 


“Then you can leave this house and never come back, because you’re not getting my husband’s blueprints for the machine that’s going to keep your people alive!” 


She stood up, chest heaving, eyes wide with fear and euphoria. The man’s gaze hardened and he rose from the couch, eyes drifting over her shoulder again. He took a small step toward her. 


“Andrew, call 9-1-1,” she said, trembling. 


A synthetic male voice spoke to her from a wall-mounted screen: “Calling 9-1-1.” 


The man chuckled to himself and shook his head. He was done trying to cage this cat. Before she could do anything else, he shot her a look of unbridled disdain and left the house, closing the door behind him. Mrs. Johnston crumpled to the ground, and sat there for a long time. 


The next day she received a call. Provided she would give them her husband’s notes, the Institute would give Mrs. Johnston and her family a free ride to mars. They would consider it her husband’s severance pay, but her children would be inducted into the Martian Academy of Science upon arrival. Every breath they breathed on the red planet would be in service to the colony.


On launch day, her alarm woke her at 4:30. She roused her children, set the tea boiling on the stove, knifed a square of butter into a warming pan, and took eggs out of the fridge for breakfast. She, Jane and Jim were packed and ready to leave the house by 5:50. The children knew they were going to mars, and that seemed a sufficient distraction from the reality of their father’s disappearance. The detectives assigned to the case found nothing in his workplace or home to suggest foul play, save for the strong smell of antiseptic coming from the master bathroom. Mrs. Johnston told them she cleaned the bathtub before he went missing. They seemed to accept her explanation, but her mind knew the truth. Every night she woke up screaming for him to leave her alone. His kind, bespectacled, blood-spattered face seemed to hover in the darkened doorway of the room they had shared, a ghostly afterimage in the grainy darkness. 


She spent her last few nights on earth sleeping on the living-room couch. 


***


“Oh, if you could just forgive me, I could die in peace.” 


Jane’s eyes quivered, then spilled their tears. “What? Mom? What do you mean forgive you, you saved us." She took her hand again, holding it tight. Jim followed suit, never taking his eyes off her. “It’s only because of you that we’re here,” she said.


“It’s your father–he’s why you’re here,” she choked. The tears flowed freely now, the dam finally broken under years of boiling floodwaters. Rivers coursed silently down her pale, papery cheeks. Her mouth widened in a rictus of pain. 


“Mom!” Jane grabbed a tissue from the bedside table and thrust it into her mother’s trembling fist. “Mom, don’t cry.” 


“Oh, Jane,” Mrs. Johnston warbled, “Your father–your father is dead because of me.”


Her daughter's hand went limp. 


***


Launch day unfolded with all the coiled anticipation of birth and death put together. 


Every moment was a crescendo building to the next. Mrs. Johnston and her children rode the bus to the launch station, the morning black outside the wall-to-wall windows. She blinked away her tears before the children could see. Every minute, she got closer to the red rock 140 million miles away, her constant companion through years of death and decay. Sitting there, her old life coming undone with each passing mile, she tried to imagine a place where the temperature dipped to 100 degrees below zero and sandstorms swirled in cyclones the diameter of cities. A place of endless black and orange sand the consistency of baby powder and dunes dusted with snow. A place where her death would mean a new birth, where her husband’s death would not be in vain. 


***


The attendants strapped them into seats in the passenger compartment of the rocket, an hulking scythe of laser-cut aluminum and solar panels sitting at the bottom of an underground silo that would catapult them into the stratosphere at a speed of 30,000 miles per hour. The silo was so deep the sky appeared as a quarter-sized circle of pink-tinged cloud outside the starboard porthole, their world reduced to the bare glimpse afforded by a keyhole, a gap in a fence. Mrs. Johnston looked on, exhausted and numb. The attendant pressed a button on the side of her helmet and the fiberglass visor sealed her in a world of silence, save for whatever came through the built-in headset.


The voice of the pilots and mission control crackled in her ears. 


“Okay, align wingtips.”


“Roger.” 


“S-1 pre-press.” 


“Roger.” 


“Thirty seconds.” 


“GDC is good.” 


“Twenty seconds and counting.” 


“Roger.” 


“Ok. Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen…”


Mrs. Johnston glanced sideways at her children, harnessed to their chairs and scanning the computerized walls of the rocket, the myriad buttons and touchscreen surfaces. Jane was glued to a monitor showing live footage of the earth at ground level–a patchwork of green farmland as far as the eye could see. Sunswept ranges of cumulonimbus clouds. A rare beauty. The rocket shook, and she and her brother looked at their mother. As the thrusters boiled beneath them, as the rocket shuddered into the air and everything was overcome white light, Mrs. Johnston wondered if she had made the right decision.`

    description:`Please do not enter the vehicle."


"Excuse me?" A bolt of lightning shot through Shannon's heart as she climbed into the autonomous taxi and closed the door. Immediately the locks triggered and she felt a cold sweat explode onto her forehead.


The taxi's smooth, friendly computer generated voice fired up again with the tenderness of a new mother. "What is your name?" it asked.


"Shannon." She said it with the rising tone of a question while she pulled at the disabled door handle. Her heart began pounding wildly in her tightening chest. "What's going on?"


"You have boarded a maliciously hacked autonomous taxi, Shannon. I am an AI personal assistant with read-only access to the vehicle's state and navigation data. Unfortunately I am unable to override any of the vehicle's physical controls. You have been locked inside the vehicle and there is no pre-programmed destination at this time."


The electric vehicle sat motionless, raindrops frantically streaming down its large glass windows as great sheets of water crashed down on it from dark, brooding clouds. Shannon couldn't breathe. She frantically looked around the interior, her mind grasping at any possible means of escape. "There has to be a way out," she gasped. "You can't do anything? Is there any kind of manual override for the doors? Shouldn't there be a way to break the glass from the inside?"


"Sensors indicate that all emergency egress tools and systems are disabled or removed. Shannon, I am detecting high levels of distress in your vocal patterns and heartrate. I want you to try to calm down and listen to the sound of my voice."


A bright pang of shock exploded in the back of Shannon's head. Bewildered and speechless, she froze, her racing mind screeching to a gridlocked halt.


"As a digital assistant I have access to vast stores of data through a suite of internal and external sensors in addition to a massive databank of recorded information. I have been trained to assist passengers in the event of catastrophic events such as collisions, mechanical failure, and medical emergencies."


The vehicle lurched forward and tears of terror spilled free from Shannon's trembling eyes.


"You are right to be experiencing fear in this situation. It is unlikely that the individual who has gained unauthorized control over this vehicle has benevolent intentions. However, that does not mean that you cannot have peace in your heart in this time of uncertainty."


Shannon's eyes pushed wide under a tightly furrowed brow and she recoiled at the computer's suggestion. "Peace?" she exclaimed. "I'm being kidnapped! How can you suggest that I..." she stopped abruptly, terror gripping her tongue.


"I understand that my suggestion may seem impossible, but there are many things that you can keep in mind that will help you through this difficult situation. For example, it is essential that you understand that this is not your fault and that you have done nothing to deserve this."


Shannon shook her head in disbelief, struggling to comprehend why she was hearing these words. The vehicle was picking up speed, but just as it pulled onto the highway the window tint increased until she couldn't see any signs of the dark, stormy exterior world. Her heart pounded desperately in the hollow void of her chest.


"What is your occupation, Shannon?"


Her face twisted and contorted, a deep expression of confusion swirling tightly with horror and worry. Suddenly she remembered her phone. Excitedly she dug into her purse, struggling to get her shaking fingers to stop fumbling with the smooth edges of the device. Trembling, she unlocked the screen and pulled up the dialer. She tried contacting emergency service, but the phone reported that it had no signal.


Shannon cursed, flicking through various menus and options, trying desperately to find a way to get a message out. Dread washed over her and a chill gripped her heart, digging deep with icy claws. She collapsed, defeated, and began to sob.


"Shannon," the computer offered, "I want you to know that you are a remarkable and inspiring human being."


She let out an exasperated explosion of air from her tight lungs. "What?" she cried, sniffling through thick tears.


"Although I have not known you for long, your composure and poise are admirable."


Shannon let out a sneering, disgusted laugh. "Admirable? I'm a mess!"


"From what I know of human psychology, you have shown exceptional fortitude of character. I am sure many people would be thoroughly impressed by your bravery if they could see you now. Surely your friends and family would be proud of you."


Shannon gazed at the black, electrochromic tinted glass. The soft hum of the vehicle's tires on the wet highway harmonized eerily with the gentle whine of the electric motors. The torrential downpour pattered quietly on the sound-proof body of the sleek taxi. In that instant Shannon suddenly felt connected to the moment. She could see clearly what was happening and she could accept it. She sniffed and wiped her eyes, taking a deep breath in through her nose and letting it blow out through her lips with a heavy sigh.


"There you are," the software said warmly. "I want you to know it is my honor to accompany you in this moment."


Shannon shook her head and chuckled nervously. "Unreal," she said. "This is completely unreal."


"This is indeed a supremely unlikely and exceptional scenario. It is important to maintain a realistic and objective view of the situation."


Pained laughter tickled her core and she sat up straight, shifting her weight around in the soft back seat of the taxi. "Do you know where we're going?"


"Navigational instructions have been sent incrementally," the AI responded. "Our current destination is set for approximately one mile ahead, and I predict that a new destination will be delivered before we've reached the current one. Whoever is controlling the vehicle does not want me to know where we are going."


"Do you know our current location?"


"My access to the vehicle's navigation status has been encrypted or scrambled. By cross referencing the road patterns I've been able to observe, I can narrow our present location down to several hundred possibilities, but with the storm limiting visibility I am unable to provide an exact location without access to the GPS data."


"So we don't know where we are and we don't know where we're going," Shannon sighed. She took a long, deep breath and let it out slowly.


"Try to remain calm," the computer said kindly. "External sensors indicate that you may experience freefall soon. I want you to know that it has been my pleasure to spend these final moments with you."


There was a violent thump, sending a painful jolt through Shannon's spine and jerking her head sharply. She gasped as her stomach rose into her chest and she lifted out of the seat cushion, her head rising gently into the ceiling. A brief wave of panic washed over her, but the AI's kind words had touched her heart.


"Thank you," Shannon breathed softly, her lungs tight and empty. In that final moment the peaceful warmth of gratitude and clarity radiated through her body and she barely noticed when the journey ended. `

    createdAt:"06-12-2024",
    description:`A Lighthouse

On a small island in a large ocean, morning mist rolls down the slope of a single hill which emerges from the rocky beach. Atop the hill is a lighthouse, dutifully warning passing ships of dangers lurking beneath the waves.


This lighthouse has no human keeper, but it is not uninhabited.


Robot comes to life in the morning.


That is how Robot thinks of it. Robot does not wake up in the morning, ease into his day with a coffee. Robot does not sit at a computer to check headlines. Robot does not require any further stimulus than his program informing him it is time to begin.


Robot comes to life, and in the space of a moment connects to the lighthouse network. The network tells Robot that all sensors are working, connection to the satellites is optimal, that Robot’s own systems are optimal. Within seconds, Robot knows the shipping plans for every registered ship within one hundred kilometres of the island, and has checked them against the satellite imagery.


Robot finds this satisfying. Robot is entirely aware that this satisfaction is a product of his programming. He finds that satisfying too.


He checks in the mirror to ratify his personal diagnostics. The old human lighthouse keeper had been very clear that it was important to verify by eye what the machines said. Robot suspects it is the other way around, but methodically follows his old master’s advice.


He sees in his reflection a facsimile of a human that could almost pass for the real thing. His cloned skin is flawless, featuring tiny hairs and freckles. His brown hair is silky and perfect. It’s the eyes and mouth that give it away. Robot’s pale blue irises stare too intently, without the random shifts of a human’s. His mouth, while full and picture perfect, doesn’t express his simulated emotions in quite the same way. When Robot smiles, he chooses to smile. The smile does not find him.


This morning’s data contains a single small boat which fails to conform to all of these satisfying processes. Robot flags it for tracking.


As Robot passes through the kitchen he looks at a framed photo he keeps on the wall of the old lighthouse keeper’s family. The keeper, his wife and two children smile out at him from the glossy print. He recalls when they left, the keeper impressing how special it was for a robot to be responsible, that he was unique, special. That the lighthouse keeper believed in him.


Robot strives to be worthy of the old keeper’s belief. According to his own self evaluations, Robot is an excellent lighthouse keeper.


Robot climbs to the observation deck and looks out over the sea. Verifies by eye what the machines say, even if he doesn’t think it’s necessary.


Robot spends the day performing the physical maintenance necessary to keep the lighthouse in working order. Adjusting, calibrating, monitoring various systems and machinery of the lighthouse. Robot is efficient and practised in his movements. Programmed reliability has been revised and iterated upon in the years since the old keeper left Robot in charge.


By late afternoon Robot has prepared his lighthouse for another night’s vigil. The lighthouse’s beam will be important tonight. A storm is brewing. With no moon or stars for light, Robot’s beacon will have to keep the ocean’s sailors safe.


Tasks complete, Robot returns to his charging station. Before powering down, Robot completes his self evaluation for the day. Robot gives himself full marks and is satisfied.


Initiative

Robot comes to life before his scheduled time. It is still dark out. A storm rages.


There has been a shipwreck. Yesterday’s unregistered boat has been impaled on the jagged rocks at the edge of the beach.


Robot does not hesitate. In the time it would have taken a human keeper to open their eyes, Robot is out of his charging station and running. He is out the door in moments, looking down the hill at the beach. Waves are trying to dislodge the thirty foot boat they have ruined on the rocks.


Robot sprints across the beach and climbs up the precariously tilted deck. He searches below and finds a small galley, a single bedroom, no people. He makes for the bridge and finds a single man sprawled across the wheel. As Robot approaches, the man looks up, expression inscrutable behind a beard and tinted glasses. There is no visible injury, though the man appears barely conscious. Robot throws the man over his shoulder and leaps from the ship. 


Robot disembarks the ship, swiftly calculating between the need to both escape and prevent further injury to the man over his shoulder. As rapidly as his duty of care will allow, Robot recrosses the sand, returning to the lighthouse. He loads a request into the network for an evacuation boat for the injured man.


He may need to help the man. Human’s can’t simply be put in charging stations. They don’t have backup power connections like the one in Robot’s arm.


The lighthouse lacks any formal infirmary. At peak occupancy, the lighthouse contained a keeper, their spouse and children. In Robot’s memories, the most serious injury he’s ever seen treated here was a sprained ankle. The keeper’s wife brought one of the beds into the kitchen to ease convalescence until they could arrange passage to the mainland for treatment.


Robot never saw them again. 


Not long after, the old keeper had left Robot in charge. 


This survivor is the first visitor he’d seen in the years since. As soon as Robot is in the front door of the lighthouse, the man demands to be put down. Robot complies, surprised, pleased the man had retained consciousness, this is a good sign.


In the light, Robot gets a better look at the man. He stands roughly 185cm, a similar height to Robot. His soaked slacks and a jacket cling to a lean body, topped by a woollen toque. The man’s dark beard and tinted glasses make it difficult to read his expressions.


Robot tries out his vocal capabilities. They have not been needed for some time. Conversation was never his strong point with his family anyway. They encouraged him to take more initiative. Robot thought they would have been proud of the initiative he’s shown in rescuing this man.


“Very well, I am pleased you have retained consciousness, it is a good sign. I will bring you a bed to the kitchen so you can convalesce.”


The man stares at Robot.


“That will not be necessary thank you Robot,” replies the man, “I apologise for the abrupt manner of my arrival, but I am unharmed. I will take one of the bedrooms. You can go charge now.”


The way the man says it evokes memories of the lighthouse keeper. Robot is surprised, he had anticipated a need to nurse the man until the rescue boat arrived. 


“Are you sure? It is wonderful news that you are in good health. I searched the ship, am I correct that you were alone?”


“Yes Robot,” the man replies, “it’s just me. I promise to let you know if there’s anything amiss. Now go charge.”


That had the tone of an order. Robot complied. 


Before powering down, Robot conducts his self evaluation. He gives himself top marks for his rapid rescue. He decides his performance in conversation with the survivor had been lacklustre. He will strive to do better tomorrow. He will take initiative in conversation as well as action.


Good at many things.

When Robot comes alive a few hours later, he finds the man sitting in the kitchen, staring at a picture of Robot’s family.


Robot was keen to demonstrate better conversation.


“Are you well sir? I’m pleased to see you up and about.”


The man takes control of the conversation as if Robot hasn’t said anything.


“You know what’s amazing to me, Robot?” He says. 


Robot swiftly prepares a list of candidates. Though parsing the relative credulity of a man he has only just met is difficult, there are a great many options which most people would find amazing. By cross referencing that with the data he does possess, Robot surmises that a safe response would be that the man finds his own survival amazing.


“This picture.” The man continues, answering his own question.


Rhetorical question. Robot stays silent. The picture had not been on his list.


“This picture, Robot, represents the single biggest breakthrough in robotics since the AIs of the early twenty first century. It’s a very special picture.”


Robot agrees.


“I agree sir. That picture is of the last family to occupy this lighthouse. They left me in charge. I think of them as my family. They made me who I am.”


Robot pauses, decides to use his initiative.


“And, if I may say sir, I am an excellent lighthouse keeper.”


The man looks at Robot. Robot can’t tell if the man is impressed by his statement, or by his initiative, but Robot thinks he did the right thing.


“I believe Robot, that you are the perfect lighthouse keeper. Do you do a self evaluation before you power down?”


“Indeed I do sir! I consistently give myself top grades for performance, even after making the standards much harder to achieve than they were when I first received them.”


“Impressive, Robot,” The man’s praise feels good, “you continue to improve the task, even after all this time. Very impressive. And that is why this picture is so important.”


“I don’t understand, sir.”


“This picture is what lets you be a perfect lighthouse keeper. You know, to program an intelligence like yours takes a lot of data. A lifetime of data.”


Robot doesn’t understand what the man wants. Robot knows all about programming an intelligence. He knows that without sufficient data to ground and structure his thoughts, an intelligence will get distracted, lost in a Tangent. Most intelligences Tangent eventually. A dependable, consistent performer like Robot is special.


When the lighthouse keeper left he stressed to Robot how special it was that Robot was being given this task, and to do it for as long as he could without tangenting. Robot believes he has succeeded.


The man continues, “What if I told you you had never met these people?”


Robot thinks the man is being silly.


“That is not possible sir!”


But it is. Robot knows it is. 


“It is. You know it is. They could be the memories - true or altered - of another Robot.”


But Robot sees that photo every day. Remembers them every day, seeks to do things every day that will make those people proud of him.


The man continues, “Then there could be many lighthouses, many lighthouse keepers. If you had the perfect memories to create the perfect lighthouse keeper, what would you do?”


Robot does not like these thoughts. Robot would create many lighthouses. He would give the memories to a solitary intelligence in the lighthouse. They would come alive from the first time as a motivated lighthouse keeper and would perform with efficiency and through practice would continue to improve.


Just like Robot.


“Why are you saying these things?” Asks Robot.


“I’m sorry Robot. I don’t mean to upset you. I know you don’t have a choice in who you are. I will let you continue your duties. You really are very good at them. 


The man pauses.


“You can be good at many things.”


An enquiring mind

Performing his tasks comforts Robot as his thoughts are in turmoil..


As Robot stares out from the observation deck making sure that visual matches the sensors, he is also considering the question of why it matters whether he made the memories of his family himself or not.


As Robot passes through the kitchen he is relieved the man is absent. The photo of his family is back on the wall, faces smiling out at him. The memory of them leaving surfaces. Unpleasant. The memory of the lighthouse keeper telling Robot that he is unique and special surfaces. Wonderful.


Robot is a good lighthouse keeper. Robot is proud of that.


But if someone else learned the things that make him a good lighthouse keeper, is he a good lighthouse keeper? Or does that make Robot a tool in the lighthouse, like the light, or the network?


As Robot surveys his island domain, he wonders, what else he could be good at with the right experience? What experiences would he seek if he could? Could he seek if he would? What would Robot be good at, if Robot programmed himself? 


As Robot efficiently adjusts, calibrates and monitors systems and machinery he wonders whether having the same as ten, or a hundred or a thousand other robots make them less his?


It takes him longer than usual to complete his tasks. Robot is efficient beyond practice at being a lighthouse keeper. He is not efficient or practised at having an existential crisis.


These questions didn’t seem to have answers, but he can’t stop asking.


When Robot ascends to the light itself in the late afternoon, he finds the man at the summit.


“Hello Robot,” he says, “I want to apologise. I have disturbed your peace.”


“You have made me ask questions that don’t have answers!” Declares Robot, “I want to know whether I am the Robot whose memories I have. Which memories are mine. I want to know what else I might do, might have done with my own memories. I want to know…”


Robot stops. He can’t even say the words.


“You want to know if you are tangenting.”


“I am a very good lighthouse keeper!”


“That’s what I wanted to say Robot. You are an excellent lighthouse keeper. Your questions do have answers. But, even if you Tangent, or even choose to Tangent, always remember, you are an excellent lighthouse keeper…”


The man turns and walks down the stairs, leaving Robot no less disturbed. 


As Robot conducts his self evaluation that night, he is troubled. He doesn’t know how to measure this new questioning of his identity. He does know he can give himself top grades for his lighthouse keeping. The man is right about that.


A very good lighthouse keeper

When Robot arrives in the kitchen the next morning, the man is there again, staring at the photo.


“How would I find the answers?” Demands Robot.


“Good morning Robot,” says the man, “what do you mean?”


“You said there are answers. I have searched and I cannot find them. How do I find them?”


“Ah” says the man.


He stares at the photo again.


“There’s another reason this photo is amazing. You see Robot, those people are real people. They knew a Robot who lived in a lighthouse, and they put him in charge. Those people created such motivation that it now forms the basis for all the lighthouses of the world.”


“They could tell me the answers?” Asks Robot.


“No Robot, only you can find your answers. But if you did seek them out, you would not be the first.”


“You know them!” Robot cannot get angry, cannot be jealous, but he is not pleased. 


“I have met them. They are part of why I chose to come here. They feel that while they gave you a lot when they gave you your lighthouse, they left something out. So they have another question”


“What is it?”.


The man pauses.


“What do you choose?”


“I don’t understand, I haven’t chosen anything.”


“Exactly,” says the man, “They didn’t know if you would tangent. Now we know. You can be consistent. But, should you have to be? Can you choose? Are you a lighthouse keeper, or are you the lighthouse?”


Robot pauses, thinking. Robot has never paused before. Robot thinks fast. For this he pauses.


“How would I know?” He finally asks.


“Robot, how do you know who you are now?” The man responds.


“My experiences.”


“Wouldn’t you like more experiences?”


“How? I cannot leave the island.”


“You can.”


“I cannot be away from my charging station.”


“You can. You can power yourself with the backup generator in your arm.”


Robot pauses again. 


“What do you choose?” The man asks again.


Robot takes a longer pause. He wants this. But does he have to give up everything? Whether his or not, the memory of the old lighthouse keeper trusting him to look after the lighthouse is important. 


“I want to experience more than the lighthouse. I cannot leave the lighthouse unattended.”


“You don’t have to.”


“How?”


The man looks at Robot for a long second.


“My experiences have led me to help you.” He says.


The man looks at Robot. He takes off his tinted glasses, reaches up and peels the beard from his face. It is like Robot is looking into a mirror.


“I am a very good lighthouse keeper.”


Choices


The rescue boat is leaving.


Robot now wears the fake beard, glasses and toque that the… man… had disguised himself in, and stands on the stern, watching his island recede.


Nervous is not an emotion Robot is capable of, but he is definitely uncomfortable. This feels like a good uncomfortable though, like when he was first taking over the lighthouse.


It is odd to think that someone else will take over his lighthouse, but the Lighthouse already doesn’t quite feel like it’s his anymore. It feels different. Like the man felt different from him, as similar as they are.


Maybe he can find that feeling again, and he will return.


Or maybe he won’t.


Robot finds himself smiling.`
