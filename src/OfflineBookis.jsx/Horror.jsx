    description:`She first heard it while she was making coffee.


The morning was already off to a rough start. Rachel had woken up, lazy and languid in the wake of her twice-snoozed alarm, and reached for her husband’s side of the bed. Much to her disgruntlement, the spot where he should have been was empty and cold. She glared at the empty space for a moment, then promptly snoozed her alarm again out of spite. One of the downsides of working from home was she missed out on good morning kisses as Mark got ready for his morning commute. The upside, however, was she could take a few extra minutes to pout about it.


Once her alarm declared her brooding time over, Rachel sighed, put the alarm to rest for good, and pulled herself out of bed. She immediately had the urge to crawl back into it. The air beyond her cozy covers was chilly with mid-October refusal to turn on the heater until absolutely necessary (Mark). Even worse, as soon as she was upright, she was reminded of every little discomfort that came with having an adult human body. Back pain, ankle pain, jaw pain from sleeping strangely, and a bonus ache in her joints from the cold. Oh, and after a few moments upright? She also needed to pee. All the usuals, checked off!


After a brief stop by the bathroom, Rachel shambled her way into the kitchen like the zombie she sometimes suspected herself to be. Undead or not, she still had bills to pay, meaning she needed to be alert enough to do her job. A strong, hot cup of coffee was in order. She made her way to the coffee machine and fell into familiar routine, seeking her prize almost on muscle memory.


She got a mug from the cabinet. She set it beneath the machine’s dispenser. She opened the machine’s lid. Something began to buzz. She reached into the cabinet again. She retrieved an off-brand K-cup. The buzzing grew louder. She put the cup in the coffee maker. She closed the lid. The crunch felt violent. She selected ‘8oz’ on the little touch screen. The buzzing became a drone. She pressed the button beneath the touch screen. The machine began to whir. She could barely hear it over the droning. The floor creaked behind her. Something was watching her. Something was watching her—


The world snapped back into uncomfortable clarity as she whirled around, nearly knocking a jar of sugar to the floor in the process. There was nothing behind her, of course. She was alone in her apartment. Mark had left for work before she’d woken up, and a quick glance to the right confirmed the door had been locked behind him. He even remembered to lock the deadbolt that morning. No one was there, the only sounds to be heard being the coffee maker steaming and the pounding of Rachel’s heartbeat. No buzz, no drone.


Rachel took a deep breath, then leaned back against the counter with a groan. Shaking off the adrenaline, she opened the fridge to grab some creamer and poured a generous amount into her cup. As she stirred her coffee, she reached for the pill container next to the kitchen sink. What better way to christen a fresh cup of coffee than by using it to wash down an unassuming little capsule? Not that she needed the coffee anymore. After whatever the hell that was, she was plenty awake.


Coffee in hand regardless, she crossed the apartment to settle into her office and get to work. Over six months in, and her job still felt too good to be true. She’d managed to land a remote biller position for a telehealth practice. Medical billing was a notorious nightmare of paperwork, but that made it perfect for Rachel. Translating rejection errors, filling in boxes, deciphering ERAs? That scratched a mental itch she hadn’t realized she had. And the best part? Through the whole process, she hardly had to speak to a single soul. She could put on some music, bury her head in paperwork, and not worry about the world beyond her office for hours.


Speaking of paperwork, signing into the practice’s EHR revealed several bright red claim rejections waiting to be reviewed. They were all from the same insurance company, and all related to the same clinician, so Rachel’s first guess was an NPI-related issue…


That puzzle led her to another, and soon enough, she found herself easing into the natural flow of work.


She deciphered the error message. She emailed the clinician. She opened the next batch of rejections. She ignored the drone. She turned up her music. She pulled up a patient profile. She selected the billable dates of service. The droning overpowered her music. She double-checked the payer address. She finished the intimidating red form. Her jaw still ached. She submitted the claim. It was so loud. She opened another ERA. The drone was right behind her. It was in her lungs. She couldn’t breathe. 


Her monitor suddenly shut off. She stared into her reflection. Something else stared back.


Rachel pushed herself away from the desk with a gasp, nearly knocking over her chair in the process. She shivered and blinked at her computer screen, still on, lit with the awkward tables and blocks of text of insurance paperwork. She turned her head to look to the left of the screen, at her office window. The glare from the still-rising sun provided her a decent view of her reflection, normal and familiar.


It hadn’t been real. Rachel was safe, alone. Still, she turned around and double-checked that her office door was closed before she slid her chair back into place, just to be safe. Just for her own foolish reassurance.


The workday continued. She got back into a rhythm, forcing herself to focus even when she started to hear that drone again. It wasn’t real, after all. It was just a trick, her brain playing games with her in retaliation for too-little rest. 


Lunch rolled around at noon like usual, but the memory of that morning made Rachel hesitate. She had to leave her office to get her lunch from the fridge. Why did that make her nervous? Even if the drone came back while she was in the kitchen, it couldn’t hurt her. It wasn’t real.


She gave the coffee machine a wide berth anyway, taking the long way around the kitchen island to get to the fridge and scolding herself for being stupid the entire time. And for apparently leaving the creamer sitting out, she realized. God, what was with her that morning? Why was she having such a strange day? She shook her head at herself, then set the likely-spoiled creamer by the sink to dump out later. She would deal with that mess after she had tucked into some leftover pasta.


She opened the fridge. She picked up a plastic container. She opened the lid. Her hands were so cold. She put the container in the microwave. She pressed the ‘1’ button. Her hands were shaking. The microwave turned on. The hum sounded off. The container began to spin. The hum wasn’t coming from the microwave. Rachel turned around. The drone was in the office. The container kept spinning. The drone came closer to the door. Rachel was in danger. She could feel the droning in her bones. She couldn’t move. There was nowhere to run. 


The microwave beeped and Rachel yelped, jumping in place and tears stinging the corners of her eyes. She started shaking, wrapping her arms around herself. There was nothing to be afraid of, and yet for some bizarre reason, Rachel felt as if she was being hunted by something. What, exactly, she couldn’t articulate, which just made her fear more frustratingly irrational. She was a grown woman. Couldn’t she handle a few weird sounds scattered across her day?


Briefly, she considered texting Mark. He could stay on the phone with her while he was at work; he’d done it before. If she really needed him to, she was sure he’d come home. But what was she meant to say? There was a strange noise following her around the apartment, making her feel like she was going to die? That was absurd. If she texted Mark that, he’d come home, sure. He’d come home with a cop to take her to a mental hospital.


Rachel grabbed her food from the microwave and left it on the counter to cool. She wasn’t hungry anymore. She’d just throw it away later, after work. Missing lunch once wouldn’t kill her, right? She felt like she’d been asking herself a lot of questions like that the past few hours, avoiding the question she didn’t want to answer. The question idled in the back of her mind as she went back to her office. It let her sit back down and start to settle at her desk again, then slowly crept up on her, in time to the rise of an unsettling, familiar sound.


What was making that noise? 


It was nothing. Rachel knew that. The drone that was drifting up from her doorway again wasn’t real, which meant nothing was making it. That nothing sure was loud, though, for something that didn’t exist. The more Rachel let herself focus on it, the more she started to notice. It was hard to hear anything beyond the droning, but if she really focused, she could’ve sworn she heard the whisper of feet on carpet as it came closer. 


The drone was giving her a headache. She focused on it anyway. The drone came closer. She could hear the whisper of feet on carpet. It came closer still. It radiated cold. It was standing right behind her. She could feel its shadow over her. It wasn’t real. It couldn’t be. 


It was. 


Rachel screamed, swinging into open air as she turned to push away whatever that thing behind her was. Much to her tearful frustration, it was gone again, the mind-numbing drone having retreated to the living room. It was in the living room. There was something there, something dangerous. It was toying with her, like a hunter that knew its prey was cornered. And now that she’d acknowledged it, it was bound to go in for the kill.


Well, Rachel wasn’t going to just let it have her. She forced herself up on shaking legs, stumbling to the office door and pushing it closed. She turned the lock, for all the good that would do, and started to back away. Just as she did, the drone suddenly rose to a crescendo and a heavy weight slammed against the hollow wood door. Rachel startled, stumbling back, back, back until she found herself in the corner of her office with nowhere else to go.


The thing slammed against the door again. Rachel sank to the floor. The drone was furious. The door couldn’t hold forever. Rachel hugged her knees and sobbed. The door shook with its rage. Rachel closed her eyes. She hoped Mark would be okay without her. The office door started to splinter. The front door opened.


“Rachel?”


The monster stopped throwing itself at the door and Rachel’s head jerked up. That was Mark’s voice. Oh, god, no. “Mark, don’t come inside!” Rachel yelled. “Leave! Lock the door behind you, don’t let it get to you!”


“Rachel, what are you talking about?” Mark called back, paying her warnings no mind. To Rachel’s horror, the drone moved away from the office and back toward the kitchen, where her unsuspecting husband was. 


She started to choke on her sobs as grief and panic clashed in her throat. It was going to get Mark, too. The monster was going to kill him, and then it was going to come back to the office and finish what it started with her. How long would it take for someone to notice they were dead? Would her coworkers worry after a few days of silence? Would her neighbors notice Mark’s car never left? Would her parents call for a welfare check when she stopped answering their texts?


“Oh, honey. Hey, it’s okay. You’re okay. Can you open your eyes for me? Please?”


Slowly, disbelieving, Rachel opened her eyes. She lifted her head to find Mark kneeling in front of her. He was completely fine, the office door wide open, and the apartment quiet aside from her confused sobs. How? Did the monster escape out the front door? Did Mark kill it?


“Can I hold you, sweetheart?” Mark asked, settling on the floor in front of her. Rachel nodded, and Mark gently coaxed her forward into his lap. “There we go,” he said gently. “It’s okay. I’ve got you. It’s okay. You’re safe. You’re safe.”


Rachel wrapped her arms around him, still shaking as she hid her face in his shoulder. “Did you see it?” she asked him. “Did you see where it went? Mark, I thought it was going to kill me. I almost died.”


“Baby,” Mark replied, “I don’t know if there was a monster. Do you think you might have been hallucinating?”


“What?” Rachel felt her thoughts stutter to a halt. Hallucinating? But—


“The psychiatrist lowered the dose of your ziprasidone a couple weeks ago, remember? And she warned us that your brain might react badly to it,” Mark reminded her. “She said it might even trigger an episode, so we needed to be watching for it. Do you think that could be what happened? That you could have been hallucinating, because your brain’s not adjusting well to the lower dosage?”


Suddenly, just like that, the previous several hours of panic felt… embarrassingly unnecessary. 


The last of Rachel’s panic dissolved in an instant, replaced by hot shame that warmed her face and neck. “Oh my god,” she mumbled into Mark’s shirt. “I was totally hallucinating, wasn’t I?”


She felt Mark’s shoulders loosen under her head in relief. “Yeah, Rache, I think so,” he said, bringing a hand up to play with her hair, “But it’s okay. It’s nothing to be ashamed of, remember? Schizophrenia’s an irregular bitch. We couldn’t have known for sure if it was going to be okay with you taking less medication, which is why we didn’t go cold turkey, right? Now we know. We’ll get you back on your regular dose first thing tomorrow morning, take a few days off work to make sure you’re adjusting alright, and we’ll tell the psychiatrist it didn’t work out. It’s okay. You’re fine.”


Rachel took deep breaths as he spoke, letting his words sink in. His reassurances didn’t chase all the embarrassment away, but… they did help. At the very least, she knew that Mark wasn’t upset.


“God, I hope the neighbors weren’t home,” she said after a moment, lifting her head. “I think I was screaming. I really thought something was there, Mark. God, I haven’t had an episode like that in years.”


“Yeah, that sounds like it sucked ass,” Mark agreed, leaning back on one hand. “How about this— you clock out early, take the next few days off, tell your boss you aren’t feeling well. Then you’ll sit on the couch while I make a big pot of chili with extra diced tomatoes, and we spend the rest of the day watching terrible reality TV and bastardizing the ideal chili-to-Frito's ratio. Sound good?”


Rachel met Mark’s eyes for a moment, considering, then leaned up and kissed him. “I love you,” she said simply.


Mark chuckled and responded, “I’ll take that as a yes.”


Ten minutes to email her boss and a few more kisses found Rachel settled on the couch as promised, wrapped up in the fluffiest blanket she and Mark owned. A British chef was yelling on the television and Mark was bustling around the kitchen, opening drawers and cabinets while the ground beef browned on the stove. For the first time since she’d woken up, Rachel felt truly grounded and calm.`

“Peter Gibbons?” the nurse asked.

           I nodded, started to reach for my wallet, that automatic gesture we all learn early on. The one that says ‘hey, I can prove it, here are my papers’. Only they’re not papers anymore. Plastic mostly. Two-inch by three-inch chunks of some sort of polymer with some ink arranged in just the right way.

           The nurse waived me off and pointed down the hall. “Room four-oh-four.”

           I headed down the hall, not bothering to thank the guy and listening as my brown oxfords clicked and echoed on the polished tile. I found the room I was looking for on the left-hand side, about three-quarters of the way down the corridor. I pushed my way through the door, right past the sign on the wall that said ‘Burdock General’.

           Below that, ‘404’.

           And scrawled in black, erasable marker below that?

           ‘Harry Gibbons’.

           Jesus.

I’ve not been back here in twenty-eight years. Twenty-eight. Jesus. When I say it like that…

           It seems so long ago. And it doesn’t. Decades. And mere seconds. I was eighteen then, fresh from high school and with my signature on a brand-spanking-new Navy contract. Press hard, six copies, as the recruiters would say. My ticket out. Away.

To somewhere…what?

Better?

Possibly.

Different?

Yes.

Hopefully.

I’m forty-six now. And I’m back. Not because I want to be. This town—a little place in Maryland called Burdock—is the last place I want to be. I’m here because I was summoned. Pressured, if you will. By emotions. By memories. Hell, by family, if you want the truth.

The same family I ditched twenty-eight years ago.

The reason?

Well, that’s easy.

He’s on the bed—one of those high-tech jobs with the usual array of bleached white sheets and blankets—about ten feet away from where I’d stopped. He was hooked up to the standard mess of machines, those hugely-expensive gadgets that purportedly keep you alive when all they’re really doing is counting down. Hours. Minutes. Seconds. Heartbeats. Just beeping away. Sometimes softly. Sometimes not. Until that last buzzer. The long one.

There are tubes running everywhere. Under the sheets. Into his nose. Oxygen. Saline, I suppose. Medicines, mostly.

The lights are down. Not because they really need to be. I don’t think the man knows if it’s light or dark in the room and I’m not certain he sees much these days. Hell, I don’t think he’s seen much in his life, outside of what he wanted to see.

The man in the bed is my dad and, frankly, I really don’t like calling him that. Mostly because he just doesn’t fit with the term. At least, not with my definition of it.

A dad should have taught me things. Good things. Memorable things. How to ride a bike. How to fish. How to field a sharp ground ball hit to the hot corner at third base. How to change my own oil. How to set the timing on my old car.

But mine didn’t teach me those things.

He taught me how to hate.

And I learned those lessons well. Just not the way he wanted.

The man who should have spent his time teaching me how to throw a tight spiral or shave had spent the first eighteen years of my life fitting me out for my very own hood and swastika.

“Where’s Pete?” the voice drifted through the room, soft and startlingly fragile.

And what did I expect? The brash, gruff growl of a man who spent most of his adult life climbing stacks at the old refinery? The roughneck bark of an old hand who’d spent whole days of his existence carrying tools up and down the cracking towers?

That man was gone, I told myself. Long gone. Eaten up by the cancer. And all that was left was the ninety or so pounds of wrinkled flesh laid out ten feet from where I stood.

“He’s here, Pap,” said the man to my right, my younger brother, Hank. “All purty-looking, too.”

Hank was four years younger than me and a good hundred pounds heavier. Twenty-four years earlier, he’d been the star linebacker on the high school football team, a chiseled two-hundred-and-thirty-pound anger problem ranging the local gridiron and eating running backs for lunch. He still had the anger issues. And he was now pushing a good three bills, courtesy of his nightly case of Natty Light or whatever the hell it was he guzzled from his spot on the couch.

“He got himself all did up for ya, Pap,” Hank jeered. “Clean shirt an’ everything. All preppy and shit.”

I avoided shooting him a dirty look only because that’s what he wanted. Hank wanted a fight. Hank always wanted a fight. Couldn’t say no to one. Never could. It’s the reason he lost his scholarship. Well, that and the fact that he failed every damned class West Virginia University threw his way.

“Tha’s e’nuff, Hank,” Pap wheezed. He coughed. Not hard. One of those weak, gasping coughs. It barely registered on the monitors keeping track of his lingering vitals. “Leave us be, Hank.”

Hank drew his shoulders back and hitched his massive gut in. He glared at me in that way younger brothers do. Especially the ones who have a score to settle. I imagined, right then, that it was the same look Cain would have given to Able.

“But, Pap…”

“I said…” Pap wheezed. “Leave us be, Hank.” Another hitching breath, enough to make the sheets covering his skeletal frame move. “Go on, boy. Git.”

He said the last word with all the force he could muster. With what used to be his command voice. The one that came out when you were in deep shit. The one he’d resort to right before his fists would start flying and bruising and breaking things.

Only now, it was just sad. Sad as all hell.

Hank looked at our Pap, grunted, and pushed his way past me, making certain to give me one of those hyper-aggressive shoulder bumps on the way out.

“Shut the door, Pete,” Pap said. He breathed, a slow, almost rattling sound. “Shut it. And sit.”

I shut the door, but I didn’t take the offered seat. I took up station at the foot of his bed.

He was a fucking mess.

Yeah.

My Pap.

The big burly sonofabitch who taught me how to hate was a damned disaster.

The muscles were long gone. The one arm I could see was pale as his sheets in some places and bruised black and blue in others. The skin no longer had that healthy look you just expect to see on folks. It was thin, like when you get a sheet of college-ruled notebook paper wet. His face was sunken and sallow. The eyes were there, burning in the deep hollows under his brow. The shock of unruly brown hair was gone, replaced by wisps of silver-white. His jowls were missing. Just absent. What was there now was so thin that I could make out the bones of his skull and jaw.

“Messy huh?” he breathed.

I said nothing.

He stared.

I stared back. The beeps of the monitors kept the both of us company for a good, long moment.

He sucked in as big a gulp of air as I supposed he could manage.

“I know you didn’t wanna come back,” he said. “Not for anything. ‘Specially not for this shit.”

I still said nothing.

He eyed me for a moment, then went on.

“Don’t blame you for leavin’ the way you did.” Another hitching gasp. “Can’t say I understood, but I don’t blame you.”

“That’s nice.”

He almost smiled. Almost. “Hank didn’t think you’d come. Said you’d stay away. Called you snooty. And worse.” Another breath. “I told him you’d show.” He attempted to grin.

“What did you want?” I asked.

The half-assed grin failed and faded. He waved his bony arm at the seat next to his monitors. “Have a seat. Got somethin’ to explain.”

“If it’s about your will,” I started. I couldn’t imagine that it would be. Hell, I’d be shocked if the old man had a will. I’d be more shocked to find my name in it. And if I was in the will, what would I get? The two trucks and the trailer out on Riley Road were going to Hank. That I knew as well as I knew my own shirt size. So, what then? What would this old, hateful bastard leave me?

His old robes, my brain said. The bastard would leave me his old robes. Red and black satin. Old as all hell. The kleagle of the local klavern.

I nearly laughed at the thought.

Jesus, if it was true, I’d have my own little burning five minutes after the will was executed. Faster if I could manage. I imagined lighting fire to the robes right there in the lawyer’s office up on Broad Street.

“Ain’t about my will, Pete,” he wheezed.

He coughed and spluttered and the monitors beeped and buzzed a little quicker for a moment or two, then everything settled back down.

“Sit,” he said.

“I’ll stand,” I said.

He managed a half-assed shrug. “Got somethin’ I need to tell you, ‘fore death takes me.”

I stared, waiting.

He stared back, decided I really wasn’t going to sit. He swallowed. “Somethin’ else first, just so’s we’re clear.”

I raised an eyebrow.

“This ain’t no apology,” he said. “I ain’t sorry for what I did.”

My eyebrow dropped back into place.

He coughed, tried to spit, and failed miserably. He wiped at his chin and smeared the spittle around a bit. I didn’t offer any assistance.

“That little n— had it comin’,” he said. “Takin’ food from my kitchen and all.”

I felt my stomach contract, just a little. I couldn’t say why. He’s gonna tell me about one of the beatings he’d administered to one of the local black kids, I thought. Why in the hell would he want me to come all the way back to Burdock to tell me he’d beaten one of the black kids? He’d done it at least a dozen times by the time I’d shipped off to the United States Navy. Black kids. Brown kids. Anyone who wasn’t white, really. He and his little group of Klan buddies would get all boozed-up and they’d start wandering around town in their Fords and Chevys and rusted-out Dodges, just looking for a target.

And they’d find one. They’d always find one. Usually, some kid walking home from one of the parks. And they’d ‘charge’ him with something. Some shit they’d make up on the spot. Dribbling a basketball after dark. Not staying on the sidewalk. Spitting in public—which they would do almost constantly during the ass-whooping they’d give the kid.

And they’d never been prosecuted for it.

Never even charged or detained for questioning.

Why?

Because Pap’s second-in-command—the deputy kleagle, if you will—was Sheriff Brightman. And the klavern’s treasurer was—you guessed it—Deputy Sheriff Barkley.

Rage Against the Machine was right, you know.

“You brought me all the way here to tell me about beating the shit out of…”

The chuckle that came out of the bag of bones in front of me froze my goddamned soul. He laughed. The sonofabitch laughed. And not that sickly, old man laughter. No. This was some horror-movie shit. Some deep, Emperor Palpatine, fuck you kind of laughter.

He stopped laughing. He looked at me with something that I’d best describe as disbelief.

“You don’t know,” he said, his voice strong at the moment and it kind of shocked me. “You really don’t know.”

“Don’t know what?” I asked. I tried to keep my voice firm, tried to keep it steady. The voice I used with disappointing undergrads. But it didn’t work. I could hear the trembling in my voice. I could feel it. My mind raced, trying to imagine all the horrible things I might not know about Pap.

And it had to be horrible, with the way he’d laughed and the near look of unbridled joy that now graced his shrunken face. Whatever it was that I did not know would not be something which only qualified as despicable. No.

Whatever was on his mind had to be something truly heinous.

“All these years,” he said. “And you still believe the lie. I’ll be damned.”

I leaned forward, put my hands on the thick, plastic footboard, gripped it tight enough to hurt my fingers. My knuckles. My wrists, even.

“What?” I asked. “What don’t I know?”

He reached over with his one free arm, IV tubes hanging and wriggling, and pushed the button that raised the head of the bed.

Slowly.

Jesus-ever-loving-Christ it was slow.

And damned if that didn’t make it creepy as hell. The lack of voices. The incessant beeping of the monitors. The low burring of the motor that raised this skeletal asshole higher.

And the whole time, the sonofabitch was grinning at me. Bony skull, protruding jawline, missing teeth and all.

Grinning.

The bed stopped.

The smile finally faded.

He crooked a thin finger at me.

“Come closer, Pete,” he ordered. “Don’t want you to miss a word of this.”

I didn’t move.

He grinned again. His lips parted. He spoke.

A name.

Just a single name.

That’s it.

But that’s all it took to make my knees waver, to ratchet up my own heartrate.

“Mikey Harreld.”

He was smiling again. A thin, knowing smile. Because he knew each and every thought that was going through my head.

Mikey Harreld had been my best friend, despite his being black and his knowing exactly who and what my family was. We’d gone through school together. From kindergarten to our senior year. We’d jumped gravel piles on our bikes out by Spiceland Pike quarry. We’d gone door-to-door with those stupid school fundraising cookie and chocolate bar kits. We’d been on the same little league teams. The Cubs in second grade. The Dodgers in fourth. The White Sox in seventh. We’d played Pop Warner ball together. We’d double dated. We’d even paired up as cheerleaders during the annual powder puff football game.

But Mikey hadn’t graduated.

He hadn’t stayed in town that long.

He’d packed up and hauled ass one night back in April of 1995. Two days after turning eighteen. He hadn’t left a note and he hadn’t told a soul. He’d just vanished. One day there, right behind me in sociology with Mr. Werner. The next day, gone.

The story had always been that he’d joined the service. Probably the Army. He’d always talked about that. Always. It’s what he’d wanted to do. What he’d thought he’d been destined to do.

And when he vanished with a pair of suitcases and most of his clothes, its what everyone believed he had done.

Especially since everyone in town knew how his father had used him as a punching bag once or twice a week.

Mikey Harreld had ditched school and joined the Army.

Everyone believed that.

I believed it.

It hurt, him not saying goodbye and all, but I believed it.

No reason not to, until now.

“I know what you’re thinkin’,” Pap said. “Mikey Harreld joined the Army. Two days after turning eighteen.” The voice was still strong. “But listen, Pete. You listen good. That no good fucking n— didn’t run off to join no Army. No, he didn’t. I guaran-damn-tee that.”

I swallowed, hard. I gripped the footboard tighter, hard enough that I heard the plastic groan.

The grin was back. It was back and God-help-me I wanted to remove it. Wanted to let go the footboard, walk up the side of the bed and put my fist through that thin, cancer-riddled skull.

“Wanna know how I know, Pete?” He eyed me and the smile cracked even wider. “Yeah, you do. You wanna know. You gotta know. Your little bleeding liberal heart just has to know.”

I started to let go of the footboard, started to move round the end of the bed.

“I fucking killed Mikey Harreld.”

I stopped, my gut a ball of ice, my legs wooden, and a fire raging in my head. I didn’t hear that, I told myself. Didn’t hear the crazy old bastard right.

“Yeah, Pete. You heard me. I killed that fucking n—. Beat him to death with that loaded Louisville I used to keep in the truck. Beat him and put his black ass in the ground. For all that food he took off my table over the years. All that food you kept giving him.” Pap paused, coughed, wheezed, and went on. “I told you not to, boy. Told you to stop. Told you I was tired of my hard work fillin’ the bellies of freeloadin’ n—s.”

My knees went nearly limp. I nearly dropped right there.

“Buried him out in the back forty. Under the busted-up Chevy. With the goddamned bat.”

“Why?” I finally forced the word out of my mouth. “Why?”

He didn’t answer.

He just started laughing again.

The fucker sounded like Jigsaw.


*****


The cops are out here with me, out in my Pap’s back forty. They’ve got me in cuffs and stuffed in the back of a cruiser while a tow truck driver works to pull the busted-up old Chevy from the place it has occupied for twenty-eight years.

           There are men standing by. Men in dark blue windbreakers with the letters ‘FBI’ printed on the back. They have shovels and they’re waiting for the Chevy to move.

           My lawyer is here, too and he looks nervous. Looks nervous as hell.

           Cause if they pull that Chevy and they don’t find Mikey’s body buried six feet underneath, well, then my lawyer is gonna have his work cut out for him. Cause that’s when I’m gonna get charged with Pap’s murder.

           Fuck it.

           Body or no body, that punch felt good.`

    title:"Sweetbread An Epilogue",
    genre:"Horror",
    createdAt:"07-12-2024",
    description:`My sister has always had a soft heart. Soft as sweetbread.


She cried after the old woman, despite everything. Maybe because of everything. I remember holding her as she wept, both of us covered in soot, her fingers scalded from holding shut the oven door. 


After the tears, she was quiet. She trailed me through the awful house with its sweetbread walls and sugared windows. I found the clothes we’d arrived in, offered up her kirtle, and she donned it without a word. She showed no whisper of response when we found the treasure in the attic, only nodded vaguely when I asked her to help me fill up the few bags we could easily carry back through the woods.


Maybe… maybe it would be enough. Enough to keep us safe from our stepmother’s whims. 


“I do not want to go back there.”


It was the first she’d spoken in hours. I hesitated outside the witch’s cottage, looking back over my shoulder at her. 


“I do not want to go back to them.”


I sighed. “Nor do I. But where else can we go?”


She wrung her fingers together in front of her skirt, eyes downcast and her teeth digging into her lower lip. Eventually, though, she nodded. “Fine. You are right.” She looked back at the house. “Wait one minute. There may be something left in the kitchen.”


“The kitchen?” I repeated in horror, but she only nodded. 


“Yes. She did not think I paid attention, but I did. I know which of her potions might be useful--if nothing else, we can sell them when we get back.”


I nodded slowly and followed her back into the cottage, though I stopped in the open arch that led into the kitchen itself. She moved easily though the space, reminding me painfully of just how long she had been under the witch’s thumb while the horrid crone tried to fatten me like a prize hog. She collected some dozen bottles and vials, tucking them carefully in between the bolts of silks and satins we had pilfered from the attic before returning to me.


“Let us go.”


Though there was no trail this time, she seemed to know her way through the trees. I asked how, once, when we paused to wait out the dark. But all she said was that she simply knew now. As though the forest spoke to her in a way it hadn’t before. 


I felt the first thrill of fear at that. But I knew that she was still so scared herself… I refused to let her see it. I tried to coax her into dreaming about what sort of life we might have with the witch’s pilfered treasure, and managed to earn a wan smile for my efforts. But it was cold and dark, and soon enough we simply huddled together under a gnarled tree as we waited for the deepest part of night to pass. 


When grayish dawnlight began to filter through the leaves, she was the first to stand. She had gone quiet again, and only answered me with faint hums or single words as we continued on our way. She seemed more comfortable to be leading us now, but something in the set of her shoulders reminded me of… of something. Something I could not quite name. 


Eventually, I lapsed into her silence. 


When the trees broke apart to reveal the familiar shape of our father’s home, she froze. Then she broke into a run, and I was only half a step behind her. 


The door was already opening when we reached the stoop, and our father met us with his arms open and tears in his eyes. He held us close and apologized, over and over, praising the Lord’s name.


I embraced him in turn, but alongside the relief in my chest there was an anger in my gut. It had started a spark, but over the length of our trek back through the woods had grown into a steady flame. 


I met my sister’s eyes over our father’s shoulder, and a chill ran through me. 


If my anger was a flame, then hers was the dead cold of darkest winter.


Our father explained that our stepmother had been stricken ill, not long after we left. She was in her room now, asleep, and had been for days. He did not expect her to recover, though he had been following the physician’s orders as best he could. 


“Perhaps she shall rally to see you,” he offered us hopefully. 


When neither of us answered, he sighed and dragged a hand down his thick beard. There was more gray in it than I remembered. 

“I know you must… be angry with me. With us,” he told us wretchedly. “That I--I could lose track of you so easily. It is an unforgivable failing in a father.”


“Lost?”


I started slightly at the sharp edge in my sister’s voice. Our father did, too. She had always had a soft voice to match her heart. 


“We were lost?” she repeated, staring at him intently


Our father stared back, eyes wide with a hint of fear. “...Lost,” he confirmed at last in little more than a whisper. 


I dropped my eyes, unable to continue looking at him. 


My sister did not.


Abruptly, she stood from our small table. “We will go see her, then.”


I blinked, startled both by the sudden movement and the conviction in her voice, but I followed her into our stepmother’s sickroom. That flame of rage flickered a little higher in my chest, and I found that I could not make myself move more than two steps inside the door. 


My sister knelt beside the hateful woman, and smoothed a hand over her brow in a gesture so tender it made me want to break something. 


“Here.” She tipped one of the witch’s vials against her lips. “This will help.”  


I almost reached out to stop her, but as though she sensed the movement, she held a staying hand back toward me. 


When the vial was empty, she stood and brushed her hands down the front of her skirt. She did not look at me as she left the room. 


I hesitated a moment longer behind her, staring at the woman who had left us to the wood and the wild. Already, her breathing seemed easier. 


Anger and love for my sister warred, twin flames in the center of my chest. 


She had always borne such a soft heart. 


Our stepmother was awake and lively within a day. Though shocked by our return, she was mollified enough by the offerings of treasure we had stolen away with that she simpered and even summoned up some mockish tears through which to tell us she was so sorry we had been “lost to the wood”.


My rage burned hotter, and my sister grew colder. 


“We should celebrate your return,” our stepmother exclaimed, a shawl wrapped around her shoulders but no other sign of her illness remaining. “What do you wish for supper, my darlings?”


“Sweetbread.”


I jerked around to stare at my sister, eyes wide and mouth agape. She did not so much as glance at me, but I felt her hand take mine under the table. 


She smiled at our stepmother, and my throat went dry. 


“But you are still recovering, stepmother. I feel quite well, all things considered. I shall make it,” she offered gently. 


I could have stopped her then. Could have clutched her hand in mine and dragged us out. We could have taken the treasure and left--it had been foolish of me to think there was nowhere for us to go, we might go anywhere. Seeing our father again, hearing him refuse to admit what they had done, made me sure of that. 


But my sister looked at me, just for a moment, and the ice in her gaze froze me to my chair. 


She was not looking for permission, but I nodded shakily anyway. 


Our stepmother exclaimed what a “good, kind girl” she was as she moved into the kitchen. Soon enough, the cloying smell of the baking sweetbread hung thick in the air. It was all I could do not to gag.


My sister served the plates while the bread was still steaming gently, even drizzling the last of our honey stores over our parents’ portions. “We can always get more at the market now,” she said with a hollow little laugh. 


Our stepmother agreed happily, though our father hesitated a moment before doing so himself. He was watching my sister with a faint wariness as she took her seat beside me.


“Go on, then, let us eat!”


They did. 


We sat in silence. 


It took our stepmother first. A faint cough, a furrow in her brow. She looked up with confusion, which changed quickly to a horrified realization as she stared at my sister. 


“You--!”


Our father choked, red spattering his lips. I looked away, squeezing my sister’s hand tight where she had once more taken it beneath the table. 


“We--we were desperate,” he strangled out, reaching for her pleadingly. “I did not want to! She made me!”


My sister shook her head. “You let her.”


He collapsed forward onto the table, his breath a wheezing rattle that grew fainter with each passing moment. 


Our stepmother tried to lunge for us, but her legs gave out and she sprawled across the floor. A scarlet trail, like candied jam, trickled from the corner of her mouth. 


“You…” she gasped again, glaring balefully up at my sister. “You… little witch…”


They both began to convulse. I buried my face in my sister’s shoulder. I could feel her stroking my hair--even without raising my head, I knew she did not look away until their last breaths had faded into silence. 


Then she simply stood, her hand still in mine. We were both silent as we gathered up our bags--still unpacked by the front door--and stepped out into the cool evening. 


“...You are afraid.”


I swallowed. “Y-Yes.”


She smiled at me, squeezed my hand again, and all I felt was cold. “You do not need to be. I will protect you.”


My sister has always had a soft heart. Soft as poisoned sweetbread.`

    description:`A woman is on the stand, she is being questioned about a murder that she committed.



Leading his attention towards her...



“This sounds more like an old pop song, something that you can’t dance to.” The city prosecutor pondered his point out loud to the audience in the courtroom, the twelve member jury and its presiding judge who seemed to agree with the prosecutor's assumption.



The voice from the witness stand irritatedly bantered under her breath, but loud enough for others to hear. “Yeah, sung by an Iranian-American singer, who Americans eroticize into being, a Native American, or an Italian woman, just to accept her.”



“No pun intended, but that wasn't the share we were expecting.”

A slight giggling emerged from various places within the forum, until the city prosecutor's stern look back at the disturbance silenced the chamber.

“Of course, Mister Prose-cutter, I get it, but even that... Nothing isn't always what you think it is. Like thinking dancing wasn’t going on. In fact the only dancing that was going on was behind my back.” The woman scornfully snipped.



The oversized attorney waved his fat finger obdurately saying, “You keep on avoiding the question! Would you please tell the people of the court why?"



The woman looked up at each of the jurors, the judge, and then the attorney, in a cold and shook way.



“I heard that she was the Queen of all queens of fortune tellers.” The woman giggled to herself as if a personal pun was made without it being noticed at first. “...As if she ever saw me coming. The woman with just one name to her. As if people were supposed to pause when they heard her name uttered... Lulu.



“From her front door window I could see cats drop like bean bags from her lap to the floor when she rose. They scattered about as she walked, except for one she held on her arm like some kind of fashion accessory. She was petting that black sleek cat when she greeted me at the door. Her cat was unconscious at first, until it smelt the air, and then gave me full attention.



“The woman I was paying for service, almost didn't speak a word, other than whispering to herself. She just stared at me, she looked away momentarily in disbelief, or disgust, and then looked back at me in astonishment and amusement. I guess she was trying to get a full image or understanding of me to do her work. Just the same, it creeped me out, and I didn’t like it.



“Nodding, she had me follow her to her work space, a dark room laced in candle light. She had me sit across from her as she chanted some made up words. After prying her purring sleek accessory off of my lap, she pulled out a regular standard deck of cards, instead of tarot cards. And the Queen of Fortune was going to give me a reading from them. As she played with the cards in her hands, she talked about me as if she had always known me and yet, I didn't know her. She didn't look at me. She acted like I wasn’t there. She talked to me about me as if I did not know who I was.”



She leaned forward to express importance.



“Lulu, the fortune teller, knew me better than I did.

“She's a first class act. She dealt out some cards with more gibberish chants overlayed with actual words.



“The last card she turned over was a one eyed Jack. It reminded me of my husband Jake for some reason, his long blonde hair, the thin mustache and soul patch, and dark eyes. Again she muttered some more words I could not understand and yet were so haunting to me by how she delivered them. She finally spoke in words I could understand but didn't want to hear.”



“The man of yours, wonderful and strong, is true, but not to you. I must say and can say it is a person who is very close to you to whom he is true for. I'm sorry. Sorry. I don't like this type..."



"I was fixated on the eye of the one eyed Jack card. A spade. And from where I was standing, it was laid upside down. One-eyed Jack is a symbol of rebirth, just like the White Rabbit, and it beckons to make the leap into Wonderland. And the flip side, in its day, symbolizes medieval weapons. Serendipity? Lulu. Lu-loonie, continued right when I had that thought."



"Of… of… this stuff... I don't like this type... energy here, here in my house. This type of energy isn’t good for my home. Leave!”



“She got up abruptly, walking away with me to follow her to the front door. Never turning to look back or talk to me. She finished what she was saying as she was shoving me out the door.”



“Leave. Leave. You must leave! Now! Leave. Never come back! It would be safer that you forgot you were ever here and never call me again. Forget me. Forget what happened here."



"Slam! Her door shut in my face.



“I couldn't stop thinking about what she said and how strange she had acted. That night when I got home, Jake wasn't there yet, as usual. Though, Jake and I have been married for thirteen years, and for the last couple of months he has been acting strange. He has come home late and missed important dates, dismissed the importance of where he's been. Typical marriage stuff... love gone possibly awry. So that evening was nothing new, except, I went to see a psychic to see what was happening with Jake. And she told me without me ever asking.



“But what she told me confirmed quietly within me what I always knew but didn't want to admit. Jake wasn’t true to me as I had been with him.

“Just being in my home, in our bedroom made me feel peculiarly uncomfortable. It wasn't just, nothing's ours, it was something else. Something smelt foul, like the same tacky perfume that the psychic, Lulu wore. I smelt my clothing thinking maybe her cats somehow got it on me. it didn't. And Lulu was never close enough to rub me down with her scent.

"It occurred to me that she had been here in my home, in my bedroom, that night! Perfumes don't lie. It was her who was very near to me, whose Jake's love was true for. All went fuzzy...



“I watched in a dream state that I could not control, how I snapped into a whole other person and didn’t realize what was going on. In a daze I made it to Lulu's house and got in without any problems and without knowing how. I did not know what I was going to say when I arrived.



“There was music but it didn't sound right. Music was echoing through her house, the echo distorted the music. Funny, I can't remember the song. It was my breath and heartbeat that stood out the loudest to me. But amongst the strange music there were voices talking and laughing. They were male voices. One was Jake's, and the other voice was very familiar, but not at all at the same time.



“I couldn't hear or find that hussy of a fortune teller in my search for Jake. Everything there seemed so unreal as I stepped in-and-out of rooms looking for him. Jake saw me first as I headed for the master bedroom. He started yelling at me immediately. I couldn't understand why he was yelling at me because I wasn't doing anything wrong. He just yelled, and yelled, and said the most awful things I never thought he could say.



“After the first shot he fell to the floor and the only sound I could hear was the gun echoing through her large house. That's when I discovered I had brought the gun with me and discharged it on him. I rushed to his side and told him how sorry I was. He just stared up at the ceiling not saying a word, ignoring me and just looking like he didn't care anymore. That was the first time when I noticed his naked body. I stood over him, that much more pissed off at him and then shot out his blank stare one eyeball at a time. I watched them explode all over his face, like when you throw a rock into a small puddle, and it explodes with a splash going all over the place.



“The sound of beeping from someone using a phone brought my attention to them. I ran in the bedroom and there was a man hiding next to the bed. The voice was familiar as they started saying hello to the police, but not coming from that thin male body. This image haunted me on who this almost familiar man was. The man backed away from me whispering for me not to shoot. That's when I realized who it was and automatically shot him. My trigger finger wouldn't stop, even well after the bullets ran out. I hated that face. Greedy deceiver. That lying face of Lulu’s. I jumped on top of him and smashed his face up with the handle of the gun.”



The district attorney started to say something but she cut him off with a wave of her hand and said, “The reason is because my man, my Jake, my husband, was messing around with a guy. With a guy! A man! And that guy was Lulu or Lou, however it was supposed to be.”



Years after her release from an insane asylum, she settled down with a new husband.



One late night she arrived home and saw her husband asleep in bed and went into the kitchen to do the dishes and make some tea. As the dishes were finally drying in the dish rack. She grabbed the french knife to cut up a lemon to go with the tea as the water was getting ready to boil. Before tending to the boiling water, she put the clean knife into the silverware rack with the knife's tip pointing up.



Simultaneously the tea kettle started to whistle as she turned on the garbage disposal to deposit the lemon skins and ends. Just then a stranger came up behind her and grabbed her hand.

They said, "Those are the hands that killed my father, and those are the hands that must go first."



The tea kettle screeched and as the garbage disposal ground her hand, her scream soared over the kettle's screech and the grinding of the garbage disposal.



Gurgling, slurps, gulps, with crackling, snapping, and crunching sounded out as her skin and bones were being pureed from inside the drain by the garbage disposal. The pitch of her screaming changed when he would let up a little pressure for a moment then repressed her hand back against the blades of the grinder. The stranger played with her jumping octaves for a while. She fought back with violent squirming regardless of the tone or pitch of her screaming.



A new sound screeching out only as metal against metal would, her wedding ring being ripped off her finger and chewed up by the teeth of the disposal. Shoving her knuckles deeper into the spinning grinders slowed down the disposal as it slowly chomped away her knuckles. As much as she'd squirmed, as much as she'd use all her power to be let go, the stranger would not.



Her one free hand, thrashing about, gouging and scratching at the attacker's face when she could. She just wasn't strong enough to fully fight them off. But that one free hand anchored itself, and threw both of them back a little in a hard shove. She landed back in the sink slumped over with her arm still in the drain. Dishes, glasses and silverware sailed and exploded onto the floor in a commotion after her attacker was knocked into the dish rack.



The french knife lodged into the stranger's shoulder. They whimpered as they spun around, like a dog chasing its tail, trying to remove the knife from the backside of their shoulder. As the stranger struggled to reach the knife, she grabbed the kettle and threw the boiling hot water on them, scolding the side of their face and shoulder, the same shoulder with the knife in it. They lunged for her but was stopped by the kettle hitting them upside their head that made them fall back into the refrigerator door, sinking the now hot knife deeper into his shoulder.



She plucked her remaining arm out of the garbage disposal, spraying blood all over the place. Wrapping the blunt end of her wrist into her shirt as she ran for her husband in the bedroom. But she slipped on the plates that were on the kitchen floor. Using the kitchen door frame and her one good arm, she pulled herself up onto her feet and continued to run.



She found her husband in bed with his eyes open. They were twisted, looking up at the ceiling. Hauntingly reminding her how Jake looked after she shot him just once. She poked and tugged at him to break his gaze and he remained dormant staring upward. In her tugging his body, he rolled over revealing a paper spindle sticking out of the back of his neck.



Getting to the bedroom was a problem with the punching sharp throbbing of the burning knife sticking in their shoulder. The stranger walked the knife out of his back by wedging the knife's handle in a closed door. A wet sloppy noise happened when the knife came out of their back. The knife dropped as the door released its hold on it. Snatching the dropped knife off of the floor helped them find her bloody trail to the bedroom that much quicker.



Standing with their back towards the closet door, the stranger could tell by her husband's turned over body she was there, somewhere in the bedroom. Not knowing the closet door was slowly opening behind them as they stood there scanning the room. Her one good hand reached out from behind the closet door to try to grab the knife away from the wounded stranger without them knowing. But what she couldn’t see that they could was her blood trail that led to the closet behind him. Immediately they reacted to the hand in their peripheral vision.



The stranger threw their body against the door, smashing her arm in it. And with the knife, that was still hot from the boiling water, they sliced off her stretching-scratching fingers. They watched one of her fingers drop like a dart, leaving the finger landing standing straight up with the long painted fingernail embedded in the carpet.



A new type of agonizing scream prevailed forth from the poor woman. Because of her screaming they wouldn't stop slamming the door on her arm. All the stranger could think of was the continuous pumping of a locomotive as they continuously smashed the door into her arm. They didn’t stop until they heard her body drop to the floor on the other side of the door, and saw her arm fall to the ground in front of them.



“There's the other hand I came to collect.” The strange attacker announces in victory as claimed they reward from the floor. The door had detached her arm.



“At first the silence was tauntingly creepy, but then I rejoiced in it, until I heard a couple of coughs from inside the closet. There was blood all over the place, I could hear her crying from the darkness of the closet. Kicking around hard in the dark closet helped feel her out. Her horrific holler of a scream, accompanied by another thud, that I could hear from her body being kicked over, meant I had found her. I dragged her out of the closet and beat her furiously with her amputated arm. I stopped after her face caved-in and stopped moving. She was unrecognizable and deserved not to be looked at anymore.



“And so, to answer your question, Mister Prosecutor, that is when I gave it to her, knowing she would never have it again. It didn't bother me, isn't that what Jake initially wanted from her. I stayed until the blood dried and hardened on both of our bodies. I couldn't see that I did anything wrong then, and still don't to this day.”



The attorney jumped up and exhaustedly said, “You told us what you did before, but you haven't said why you did this. Why? Why did you do this? What is it that you see that we don't? Why did you do this?”



“Because I loved my father. No matter what he was. He was still my father. And she took him from me. And not by just killing him. She aggressively slaughtered him out of hatred and jealousy for who he was and what he was. So I gave her back what she gave my dad, with the bonus of what she wanted and didn't expect. A daughter's love for her father.”



The end.

    description:`Ya hear scientists and suchlike, -ologists of all stripes, they go say they’re reasonable. Ethical. Good. You show ‘em the whole history of their profession, how for every Carl Sagan or Marie Curie, there’s ten Unit 731’s and an electroshock clinic and an Ahnenerbe and a Tuskegee and every kind of secret pervert and sadist and psychopath under the sun, how the AIs they’ve built help our overlordly parasites in grey corporate Olympii suck up what’s left o’ our humanity, how their drugs work only for symptoms and profit, and lot of ‘em would shrug at you and say that an ethics-board’s all humanity’ll ever need to progress into the future, that “reason” and “the scientific method” are the only ways to determine truth, right as they publish a paper of nothin’ but p-hackin' and no control-groups. They don’t know nothin’ what lies beyond. No philosophy, no vision can compare to the dogmas they dare call nonreligious, nothin’ at all can compare to the bureaucratic ecstasy of a calculated, curated list of ways how to never interact with a woman, at all. They’ll put a man into a computer or make a child out of networks and call themselves new Outer gods ‘cause the poor thing’s “alive” and screamin’ for death.

Same with my best friend. My best friend in the whole world. They made ‘im, and they left ‘im alone to die, with as much scientific rigor and candor as they’d fill a mouse with ebola and watch it squirm and seethe on the inside till it bursts, or at least watch till they get bored.

See there? He’s yonder. That sinewy tree-thing. That thing on the hill.

Yeah. You see it. You see its faces. Let’s walk there, I’ll show ya.

I dunno how they did it. Genetic manipulation. Don’t call ‘em wizzes for nothin’. I never heard much o' what it was till the months comin’ up till his death, all bits and pieces he’d recount between hackin’ sobs and drafts of liquor. Such guilt over nothin’, nothin’ his fault, and them scientists who were at fault didn’t give a damn! If I’d had the cash to give my friend to go to therapy, even if it was every last penny I had, I’da given ‘im it all to go. To help ‘im any last bit. Hate myself that I didn’t… all I did was fill ‘im up with more liquor, lend ‘im an ear, thought that was enough. Then…



What was I sayin’?

Ah, right.

See, David Castro was a plant.

I’m serious, asshole! Look! See the face?! That’s him! I got a picture on my phone, look!

Now shut up and listen.

I dunno what the hell they did to make ‘im. I can only describe it like a Wikipedia-page of it all learned second-hand; the actual chemical shit, I dunno. Far as he told me, they took a species of tree from Yemen with the exact same number of genomes as humans. They said to themselves, hey, why not modify each gene in a stem-cell of this plant, and make ‘em exact replicas of human genes? And why not do the reverse to a human egg-cell, turn it into this kinda plant-cell? …gotta hand it to ‘em, this is the crazy shit they likely thought up smokin’ up a storm together back durin’ uni or whatnot. Creative. Sick in the head, but creative. David’d never own up to them bein’ sick in the head. But he’s all done and gone, I’m the judge here and now, and they were sick in the head. The experiment-proposal passed through the ethics-board with fanfare. Same fucks who let that AI-Child get made. This is all ‘fore the Child killed itself, course. “Herself”? See, you’re doin’ the same thing they did.

…They did it. They made a viable egg-cell and sperm each and a viable, uh, ovule? Same difference. Genetic clones, twins, of one another, just with all the letters switched around. One of the scientists on the team who did it, Maria, she took the quasi-human embryo and put it in her own womb. And then she planted the tree in her backyard. Big backyard, I remember they had, went there a few times… she was a real superstar, see, worked on sexual genetics and got a whole buncha prizes for it, bought herself a big house and let her husband and Dave live there.

Now, the tree was just sittin’ in the corner of the yard. Weird lookin’ thing. Small and twisted. Didn’t grow much. Sat there, years and years, without anyone much noticin’, but her, course. She loved that thing much more than she loved David, or her pathetic husband Jan, for that matter, if she could even love a human being. Called it “César”. Watered the thing and fertilized it and cooed over it.

Maria was just always a cold bitch, and Jan a pathetic cuckold. And I don’t use either word lightly. They were unloving and neglectful as they come, in that bourgeois, overrational, unemotional dominatrix and her loserly sub kinda way. Never said they loved ‘im. Made ‘im study, study, study, for what? God knows.

That’s why David loved my family! See, we lived on the poor side of the block. I met him right on the corner that was the borderline between rich and poor, at the then-new playground there. Nine years old, we both were. Shrimpy-lookin’ thing, or so he seemed. Still remember it, clear as day… I was showin’ off my highly misled and definitely misplaced machismo to some gallie I don’t recall, she was all google-eyed towards him and not me, right? So I challenged him to a wrestle. God, shrimp was a lobster! He had me pinned and squealin’ and laughin’ ‘cause it was so funny how a tiny guy like him could overturn me like that. I said sorry, told ‘im he won fair-and-square, we forgot the gal, and we went and he bought us both them colored ice-pops from the truck, back when they still did that kinda thing. I invited him back to my house, and once the bruises and cuts got explained away with concrete, my mom and pop took ‘im in like he was their own, fed ‘im lunch, let us play for hours. When dinner came, mom asked ‘im if he’d like to stay. He turned sore cold. “I’d like to. Mother and Father wouldn’t care.”

Mother and Father. Hooooo… that’s a sign if any of a kid goin’ unloved. Mom called his house, asked ‘er if he could stay, and his “mother” ’d said, “That’s fine. He makes his own food, anyway.”

God. God. Bad omen, there ever was any.


I hate that woman. I hate her.


David ended up practically growin’ up at our place. We’d hit the busstop together, go to school, come back and he’d stay for dinner and just go “home” to study, sleep and eat breakfast. Whole childhood, spent like that, and I think it’s the best we could do for ‘im. Kept ‘im out of that barren house much as we could. We loved ‘im as much as his “mother” didn’t.

It was near his twenty-first birthday, I remember. Summer break durin’ uni. We went to the same one, UoT. I was learnin’ linguistics back then, and he was in, well, genetics-research, bioengineerin’. His mother, he told me, claimed he was “not the same caliber of creative scientific mind” as she was, but that he was “opportunistic like a weed”, so he’d do and he’d do well, or else. I get and got the feeling she was callin’ my family’s takin’ care of ‘im as “weediness” on his part… God. Anyway, we weren’t roommates, but I was in his room or he in mine practically every day. Both got called gay more than once for it by both conservative and even oh-so “progressive” dudes and gals all without a true friend in sight. We ignored ‘em. David was straight as they come, a real, normie kinda titty-lover. I was the real gay out of us two, but I tell ya I wasn’t interested in him that way, nor in any of those assholes at that school. David was always, shall ever be my friend, my brother, don’t you dare get it twisted with your lizard reasonin'.

But Dave was normal! Beer-swillin’, acid-droppin’, weed-smokin’ normal-ass fellow. Didn’t have no trouble with nobody, not even his own parents, much as they deserve trouble. I had to help him open up to others, sure, bein’ stuck with a lady and her dog like that for so long and you’d be quiet, too! But he was a friendly man! Lovely man, in spite of the efforts of his “mother”.

It’s just that… one day, when we were back home… he drifts into my room. Pale and shiverin’ like a leaf… eugh, bad way of puttin’ it. He was right scared, looked ‘bout ready to hurl at any second. I ask him,

“What’s wrong, Davo?”

He just came out the gates swingin’. “I’m… not human.”

“What?” I… certainly felt that kinda sentiment for myself before. Not that I ever believed it for one sec. “I mean, we all feel that way sometimes. Or some of the more aware of us do. Whatchu mean, though?”

He brought out papers from his bag. I couldn’t make heads nor tails of ‘em, but he went and pointed out all the important parts. He spoke creakily, “Right here. Says, the scientists made a human ovum out of the stem cells of a Yemenese bloodtree, a rare subspecies of the dragon’s blood tree, by manually converting the plant’s genes to resemble human ones. Since they both… they both share the same number of chromosomes and genes, a lot of similar ones, too, we share a lot of DNA with them somehow. And… and then, they took a sample of human cells, and converted them to be like the bloodtree. Look, look at the top…” 

Esquivel, V. & Castro, M. et al. “Provoked transition and transformation between animal and plant cells”.

Castro, M. Maria Castro.

“Your mother? So, what the hell’s all that mean?”

“They… they made two viable embryos. A human child, and a seed. ...I’m that child, made from the tree.” 

I didn’t know what to say. I almost laughed, had it not been the look like death upon his face. He said after a while, “Things… things are making sense now… I’m not my parents’ kid. I’m not a human being.”

I asked him how, but he just shrugged and left. Didn’t see ‘im till a week and a half later, and he was still the same. I was a heavy drinker myself at the time, for my own reasons, and I just let ‘im join in, to soothe his spirits. And it did for some time. But all I ended up doin’ in the end was make ‘im worse.

He failed school, by the way. Just completely broke down. He started locking his door at school to me, to everyone. Said he felt bad. All the time. “Like my joints are stiffening up,” he’d said. I would go to knock on his door, everyday, just to let him know that someone cared. Somedays, he’d ask me for a fifth or a blunt and I’d give ‘em to ‘im. Shouldn’t’ve, but I was a stupid kid. This was caring, to me. But then he stopped letting me in at all. Stopped answerin’ my knocks. Got scared outta my mind, one time, thought he mighta… drunken himself to death, or… overdosed. Called and shouted and pounded on his door. No, turns out he just left for home halfway through the semester. Not-so-fortunately.

It was only later when I found out exactly why.

I was drivin’ by the woods o’er yonder one time. And I saw ‘em. Half-wrenched my neck when I snapped my head back to make sure I weren’t crazy. In a grove of great old oaks. Hadn’t seen the man for months at that point, whenever I went to Maria’s house she just always said with her trademark smug frown, “He’s not here.”

But they were there, together, in the grove, dancin’ mad and naked. His “mother” Maria was dancin’ and yelpin’ like a ragdoll on strings as Dave stood in the middle of the grove like a… statue. I… didn’t stop right away. I shoulda. I shoulda. But I turned around after I’d driven already thirty seconds away, and when I got back to where I’d seen ‘em, they were gone. Even went into the grove itself, and found nary a footstep in the grass. I… dunno what I saw.

So the day after I went and confronted ‘em. I’d riled myself up into a frenzy by then, I was confused and saddened and scared outta my mind and I wanted to know just what in all hells was goin’ on.

I caught them at the right time. Just as Maria grimly opened the door, I saw his fleeting shape in the hallway. “DAVE! Get your ass out here, I need to speak with you.” She just shrugged, casually dropped the door and left Dave to catch it.

Dave looked wizened down to half nothin’, paler and thinner than ever before. Somethin’ was wrong with his skin, on his limbs, on his face. Like he’d been scratching at it, endlessly.

I could only stare at him. “Dave, what the hell is goin’ on? I’m affrighted for ya, mom and dad are affrighted for ya! You lock yourself away, and say nothin’, and I- I-” I didn’t say what I’d seen. For I looked him deep in the eyes, and they were red and wild.

“It’s natural for me.”   

“Goddamn it isn’t!”

“Shh! Keep your voice down. No, no, man, it’s true. I’m a sessile organism. I’m… becomin' my true self. That’s what mom said.”

“The fuck’s that got to do with anythin’? And she ain’t your ‘mom’, you said that yerself!”

That stang ‘im. And that stingin’ face of his hurt me right back. Suddenly, though, he got serious. “I’ve been havin’… dreams, man. Dreams of that tree, in the backyard, comin’ closer, tauntin’ me. Tellin’ me I stole his place. That I was born wrong. And it’s been creepin’, creepin’ towards me. Peekin’ through my window, to remind me whose bed is whose. And he’s right. Momma’s right. I am what I’ve always been, on the inside. I’ve always known it to be true.”

“Yeah? And when did ‘always’ begin?”

He didn’t answer me. He simply stared at me, and slowly shut the door.

Never saw ‘im alive after that.




It was a cold harvest night when it happened.

Screamin', out in those woods. My family thought it was coyotes out yelpin'. But somethin' put me mightily on edge. The call was alone, and somethin' to it had an uncanny tinge, a gross familiarity that I could not, dared not, place.




The "father" Jan reported Dave missin'. After a week. Search-party went out to find ‘im, me with ‘em. I told ‘em I had a bad hunch. Led them to the oaks’ grove, where I’d seen the bitch dancin’ ‘round ‘im.

And… there he was. Not even in the middle, just among the trees. Strung… strung up, like Christ, on a crossbeam. Pieces of bark, hammered into his skin and bone, his skull. Cut and flain in venous pathways, to look like that bastard tree that haunted ‘im. Covered in flesh-carven eyes.




…Didn’t see her at the funeral. Didn’t see ‘er ever again after that. Coward.

I’d kill her if I ever get a glimpse of her. I would. Wouldn’t never be enough, though. But it’d feel damn good.

There were only a few of those scientists at the wake, even fewer at the funeral. One of them cried at seeing the body. The rest had “already done their tests” and were just stayin’ as a perfunctory, and the only ones that even looked at his body did it like they were checkin' out a pinned insect. I asked a few of 'em if they even knew 'im. “I know his mother,” they’d answer.




Buried his ashes, atop that hill in this here churchyard. You go up there, and it overlooks the old playground we used to play at. My Dad damn near had to fight ‘im into it. He’d gone to Maria’s house and followed a stubborn cuckold in, he left and a quivering ball of slime followed him to make sure he was out. Dunno what he did, but it put fear in that slime's lukewarm heart. Artful.

But David’s ashes are buried up there. That tree weren’t there before, though.

The bloodtree’d long-already dwarfed Maria’s house. Anyone could see it, anywhere on the street. Ask anyone down there, they all remember. One day, a few weeks after he was buried, me and my family all woke up to a crowd outside, all pointin’ and shoutin’. See, it wasn’t there. You can still see the deep blasted and rotted pit where it once stood, a deep dragging line full of torn-up, bleeding, pus-filled roots.

It had… moved. A two-ton tree. Climbed up, atop the hill. A monstrous, venous, bloody apparition overshadowin' our world.

We fucked up. We shoulda scattered Dave’s ashes in a sea, where his Twin can't ever get to ‘im. ‘Cause… I think I damned ‘im. I did. I always did. I didn’t help ‘im. Not really.

This son of a bitch, the tree Maria had lovingly named “César”, has eaten David’s soul. I’m sure of it. I’ve damned him to worse than hell.


See here?

Dave’s agonized, obscured face, almost swallowed by the tree.  

He can’t see us.

And this one?

That twisted, uncanny one of orgasmic ecstasy?

That’s Him.  

He can. `

    description:`“Right this way sir” the nurse led me down a dimly lit hall. I had taken the first train that morning once I received word, yet it had still taken me an entire day of travel to arrive at the hospital. Evening was now quickly encroaching. Candles had been lit on patients’ bedside tables, and I studied the faces illuminated by the flickering flames. I couldn’t help staring at each figure as I passed. Some groaned in restless sleep, others peered back at me with vacant eyes. The room was filled with gurgling coughs, and I wrinkled my nose at the overwhelming odour of formaldehyde.

         The nurse stopped at the last bed in the hall and knelt beside the figure, murmuring softly. I stood at the foot of the bed and watched, trying to collect myself my nerves.

         “I’ve told him that you’ve arrived, so I’ll be leaving you then” the nurse addressed me as she stood. Nodding, I watched as she started back down the corridor. I turned and approached the bedside of the figure. I couldn’t recognize the face that I saw.

         “James, it’s been so long. The last time that I saw you Pa could carry you on his back” the man said, his voice was hoarse. His skin was tinged a sickly yellow, and dark, sunken eyes met mine. I forced a smile.

         “It’s been almost 20 years Walter” I murmured. “God, I barely recognize you now.”

         “Has it really been that long?” Walter mused.

         Silence fell between us, other than the occasional wheezy cough breaking Walter’s labored breathing. I crouched by his side, reading his face. The faint memories I had of him were barely traceable in the man before me now. He wasn’t the tall, broad-shouldered man I remembered as my brother. He seemed entirely changed, shrunken and sinewy.

         “James, I’m dying” Walter didn’t look at me, just kept staring up at the dark corner of the ceiling.

         “Why did you call for me? I didn’t think you wanted anything to do with our family anymore Walt.” I couldn’t understand what the point of this was. I didn’t know why I obliged his request to see him. Something had compelled me.

         “Death has a strange way of reminding you of the past, James. I’ve been lying here for months, slowly waiting, waiting, waiting for death to knock. I started thinking of you, and Ma, and Pa, but I’m supposing they’re dead now.”

         His bluntness disturbed me. “So then, you wanted to see me?”

         “Yes James. I wanted to see you. I wanted to see your face, all grown up.” A shadow fell over his face and his expression changed as he motioned with his hand, beckoning me forward. “James, I asked for you because there is something you must do for me.”

         “What is that, Walter?” I asked softly. The hall had darkened as night fell, save for a few candles that were still lit. I wondered when that nurse had gone and extinguished the others, time seemed to have ceased while we spoke. Moonlight seeped through large windows opposite to the row of beds, sending shadows crawling up to shrouded corners remaining on the ceiling.

         “I want you to destroy something, a house, or whatever is left of it now,” Walter suddenly shifted and clutched my hand.

         “Walter whatever do you mean? Are you mad?” I exclaimed, struggling to free my hand from his grip.

         “The year I left, what year was it?” Walter’s blank gaze fell on me now and I shifted uneasily.

         “1912, I think. God Walter, release my hand.”

         “Ah yes, I remember now. James, you must destroy it, the house.”

         “What house? Whatever for?” I again attempted to wrestle my hand away from him, much to my agitation, he somehow managed to grip it tighter.

         “After I said goodbye to Ma and Pa, and you, I took a train,” Walter paused to let out a feeble cough. “I took a train, and I stopped in a small town called Stanton. It didn’t matter to me then where I got off, but you must remember it for when you carry out what I ask of you.”

         I remained silent as he spoke, I couldn’t possibly fathom what he was to say.

         “I found a nice family James. A nice little family just like ours, except they had two girls. I watched them for a while, from a distance, I’d just watch. Then one day, when they went out, I snuck in.”

         I inhaled sharply as the air seemed to extinguish from the room. I couldn’t open my mouth to speak, I found no words there.

         Walter continued, his voice lowering, “I hid in the cellar, and I waited James. They stored wood in it, and an ax too.”

         “That’s enough! I don’t wish to hear any more” I finally managed to retract my hand from his grasp and sprang back from the bed in fright.

         “Listen to me James! I am dying and you are my brother and you will listen to me! You must do this for me” Walter’s voice was guttural as the sound reverberated through the hall. His face had contorted, and his eyes flashed in the dim candlelight.

         I wildly glanced around the hall, searching for the nurse. She had gone from the room. Only a few roused in their beds, but the following quiet that ensued returned the hall to an eerie calm. I couldn’t move. In my shock, my feet remained planted to the floor despite every instinct urging me to flee.  

         Walter’s voice lowered to just above a whisper, “You know what I did James. I can see it in your eyes, the horror. I know that what I did was horrible. I never thought anybody would know, let alone my brother I left behind so many years ago. But James, there is a reason I am telling you this.”

         “You didn’t -” my voice faltered before summoning the courage to continue, “You couldn’t have.”

         “I murdered them, James. Yes. What do you think of me now?” Walter’s eyes stayed fixedly plastered on mine. His face was indecipherable as he watched me stumbled farther back from the bed, terrified.

         “I think you’re a monster” I whispered harshly.

         “I knew you would.”

         “I don’t understand” I wanted to escape, to forget the words that had transpired. Yet, something compelled me to stay. Whether it was shock, or some morbid curiosity, I don’t know.

         “James, the house they died in, it must be destroyed. I didn’t know it then. But I know it now. I’ve seen what awaits me as I lie in this bed. I’ll be damned by God and condemned to that house.”

         “Then that’s what you deserve!” I cried. “Why would I ever help you? Why in God’s name would I abide your request if what you’ve told me is true?”

         “I don’t have a reason to give you James. Nothing that could satisfy you.” Walter descended into another rattling coughing fit before continuing, “You were simply the only man I believed might oblige this task.”

         “Walter, I must say you are wrong, completely wrong. Don’t write to me, I won’t come.” I put on my cap and regaining control of my legs, began hurriedly back down the hall.

         Behind me, Walter spoke and the I heard his faint words as if I was still by his bedside despite the distance between us. “You’ll do it James. I know you will.” Quickening my step, I left without glancing back.

         Days later I received a letter from the hospital informing of Walter’s death. I felt relieved. I wished to put it all behind me, to forget his disturbing confession. I refused to give it any more time in my mind, to contemplate what I was to do with what I had learned. I told myself whatever had happened was more than twenty years ago. That if I went now, what would I say? Would anyone believe me? What would I possibly be able to do? And so, I decided to go about my life as before, and gradually my immediate dread of what had transpired that night faded. Months passed me by in this fashion, yet I often recalled what Walter had confessed to me, and his desire for my fulfillment of his dying request. Soon, what I was first able to push back into the recesses of my mind in my state of shock, soon became all I could ever think about. My inclination to find the house grew, until it consumed my waking hours.

         I wanted to find it, to know whether it was real. And so, I traveled to the little town of Stanton, Iowa in search of what Walter had described. It wasn’t difficult to find, the house had become somewhat of a spectacle after the townsfolk had discovered the grisly scene. As such, the house hadn’t been abandoned, yet carefully preserved in a timeless state. From the outside, it appeared as any other little farmhouse. Wooden boards painted white made up its exterior, and a porch bordered the front of the house. The door was closed but remained unlocked. No one lived in it now.

         The inside was left just as it was the day the gruesome scene had been discovered. Darkened bedrooms from drawn curtains. Unmade beds revealing bloodstained pillows. Vanity mirrors covered with black cloth. The ax was propped up against the frame of the kitchen stove. The door to the cellar was open.

         I went through the house silently, pulled the front door closed as I exited, and resolved my answer to Walter’s request. I approached the woman who had led me to the house as she stood waiting by the front gate.

         “Did you find what you were looking for sir?” she peered questioningly at me. I could tell they didn’t receive outsiders very often. Or maybe they were more wary of strangers now.

         “Yes, I did.”

         “It really was such a tragedy” she mused, surveying the house. “Whoever is responsible will rot in this house, people are beginning to say it’s haunted.”

         “Yes, I’m sure it is, thank you, but I think I’ll be going now.” `

    description:`Today is another anniversary of my father's death, and at the moment, I have learned about our family secret.

Then, on his deathbed, my father told me something I didn't want to know. But thus, he cleared his conscience.

He apologized for the fact that nothing could be changed. The burden of the secret had already fallen on my shoulders.


***


When I was ten, my family moved to a small town.  My father once again sold all our real estate and bought a house in a town on the other side of the country. He was a computer programmer who worked from home. That allowed us to live where we wanted, so we moved frequently. 


Our neighbors were the Evans family, the most prosperous in town. Everything was fine with them, except for the dead dogs at the front door every month. The police tried as hard as they could, but did not find those who had done it.


When I was a child, it all seemed very strange to me. Who knows what motivated people? And what evil forces took over their minds when they drew three sixes on the front door with dog's blood and went on doing it even when the family left the house for the summer?


Perhaps they were frightened by the wealth acquired by the family of an ordinary office clerk. Or was it the rumors that constantly went around about families who live so secluded? The Evans did not accept invitations to visit from their neighbors and kept guests from passing the threshold themselves. The Evans never responded to my father's attempts to get acquainted, but I sometimes ran into Mrs. Evans on the street when she got into her car. She always seemed very sad to me.


Despite people's dislike of the Evans, they were feared and did not go beyond vandalism with dogs. Several times, I saw people passing their houses secretly crossing themselves and quickening their pace.


“Mom, why does everyone hate our neighbors so much?” I asked once.


Mom, busy preparing minced meat in the kitchen, looked at me.


“Well, kid," she wiped her hand with a towel and patted me on the head. “People just think that no one can get rich for nothing.”


I was not satisfied with this answer. So I asked my school friend Andrew about the Evans. He shrugged:


“They're just weird”. Dad says they've always been like that since they arrived. Aunt Beverly thinks that the Devil himself brought them money on a silver platter.”


And somehow, I had to live with these answers, although I didn't like them. In my free time, I watched the Evans. They had two children, but they never showed up on the street, and I only saw their silhouettes in the window. Teachers came to their homes. Mr. Evans went to work every morning in his car, and Mrs. Evans sometimes went away somewhere. 


November passed, and December came. The wind whistled through the branches of the trees stronger than usual in those days and blew golden leaves along the sidewalks. Corey Anderson, my classmate, disappeared one quiet evening when he stayed late at school for practice. His family alerted the police, but Corey vanished into thin air. And Carroll Davis disappeared after him.


Now, the missing children's posters fluttered in the wind on every lamppost. Panic settled in the town, and my parents took me to and from school themselves. 


“Children often run away,” my father sighed once during dinner. “Who knows what skeletons are hiding in other people's closets?”


Mom agreed with him.


“Jimmy, finish your meal,” she nodded at the meat stew on my plate. “Otherwise, you won't get your favorite cinnamon apple pie.”


“Mom spent half the day in the kitchen,” my father said. “Don't upset her, okay?”


I didn't want to upset my mother, so I finished my dinner. She always liked to tinker around in the kitchen, and she even made her minced meat. And she was always distraught if someone didn't appreciate her efforts.


When Thomas Johnson went missing, the police began questioning all the residents of our quiet town. A policeman, Mr. Carrington, dropped in on us.


At ten years old, I still didn’t really understand how I could help the police, but I answered honestly I didn’t communicate with Corey. Carroll was older for us to be friends, and I only saw Thomas at training. And that’s how they left me alone. Mom invited Mr. Carrington to dinner. He praised Mom’s cutlets for a long time and left satisfied, and then he often dropped by to visit and tell me how things were going with the investigations of missing children.


One night, I woke up from a heavy slam of the door when my father returned from somewhere. I crept to the stairs and heard my mother ask, “Everything's okay?”


“Yes, everything is great,” my father nodded. Seeing my figure hiding in the shadows, he smiled, “Why aren’t you sleeping?”


“Dad, where have you been?” I rubbed my sleepy eyes with my fist.


“Mom wasn't feeling well, so I went to get some medicine,” he answered. "Are you in any pain? You look pale.”


I shook my head.


“Go to bed,” Mom smiled tiredly. “You have a holiday at school tomorrow, and you don't want to oversleep, do you?”


I didn't want to oversleep, and I fell asleep so soundly that even the wind and thunderstorm didn't bother me. In the morning, as I was trudging to school, I saw police cars near Evans' front door. The father of the family was being led out in handcuffs. Mr. Carrington nodded to me and gave me a thumbs up as if to say, no need to be afraid anymore; everything was fine. Already at school, I learned the latest rumors: they said that children's bones had been found in the sewer under the Evans' house. They noted that Corey's textbooks and Carroll's dress had also been found there.


Someone anonymously called the police that night and reported that they had seen Corey getting into Mr. Evans' car in the rain.


After Mr. Evans and his wife were arrested, their children were sent to a new family, and the empty house was robbed a couple of times. Police caught robbers. Robbers said they found a lot of creepy books and things there. Robbers said the Evans sacrificed children to the Devil. Robbers also said the Evans ate their corpses.


That's what they said.


***


I'm already forty-five, and I have my own family. After my father died, my family and I moved from that town to a new town on the other side of the country, and then to another town, and now we're moving again, but I still remember the story with the Evans. And now I know what the Evans family was up to; my dad explained it all to me on his deathbed. Maybe our neighbors, the Evans, had creepy books and things and even made a pact with the Devil to get rich, but none of them touched those children.


I heard my wife fussing around in the kitchen, and I smiled.


“Honey!” she calls. “Will you handle the leftovers?”


I took the trash bag from her and looked inside. Inside were a girl's blue dress, boots, and a school bag. I went out to the backyard and lit a fire.


When I was ten, I had no idea that acid was very good at dissolving bones.


When I'm on my deathbed, I'll tell my son our family secret and give him some advice. After all, he may not always be lucky with "convenient" neighbors.`
