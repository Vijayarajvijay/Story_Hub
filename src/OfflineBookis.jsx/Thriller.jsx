Part I: Steve


Debbie said that it was lucky for us, that the weather would make for fewer people on the roads, less chance we’d be seen. Twenty-five freaking degrees? I do not like the cold.


This will be the first time I’ve ever done anything with Randy. This thing was his idea, I think, but it was Debbie that brought me into it. There’s six thousand dollars to be had and it sounds like no problem having it – if you don’t mind robbing some old lady, which I don’t.


This weather is awful, though. They’re always predicting snow, but we don’t usually get any. When we do get it, it’s pretty, covering up the trash on the ground, making the town look better than it really is. 


So, Debbie told me about this and then has Randy tell me the details. We’re planning on tricking this old lady, but they don’t really have a handle on how to do it. We’re going to tell her they’re from the city, tell her they need to look inside her house. Randy looks like a teenager and Debbie’s a girl. They need me to be the man from the city.


I told them I had a blue shirt with badges on it. It had belonged to my brother Danny, who’s doing time in the state penitentiary, back when he worked for the city. I’ve got his van, too, and it’s plain white like a service vehicle.


Debbie was Danny’s girlfriend before he got locked up. Now she’s Randy’s. She ought to be my girlfriend because I’m a lot more like Danny than Randy will ever be. But I get it. Randy is smart and Debbie wanted somebody who was not like Danny.


So, we got this plan. It’s Randy’s plan, but we’re all in on it.


I have a gun. It’s a gun Uncle Terrell gave me when I was a kid. It’s a 22, but it works. Randy said not to bring it, but I really want to have it with me. You can never tell what might go wrong. What if this old lady has a gun? Did he ever think about that?


So, I got the shirt and my van. We got what we need.


This morning, we went back over what to do. We go to the old lady’s house at a little after 12. Traffic in town is busy, but this place is outside of town. It’s on a street that zig-zags off from the highway toward Atlanta.


I drive up in front of the house, parking so that she can see the white van if she looks out the window. I get out and go up to the door with Debbie behind me.

Debbie is going to be wearing a big coat and I’m going to say she’s my trainee.


First though, I have to tell the old lady that there’s been a problem with her electric bill and that she’s being charged too much. The city is sending me to fix it, I’m gonna tell her. She opens the door – because who wouldn’t want somebody to fix it so that a bill is lower – and that’s when I tell her who Debbie is supposed to be.


I’m asking the old lady where the kitchen is because this problem is probably at the outlet the refrigerator is plugged into. When she starts to take me there, Debbie asks if she can use the bathroom.


While I’m in the kitchen, Debbie goes to the old lady’s bedroom. Randy says the money is in the bottom drawer of her chester drawers. I keep the old lady busy till Debbie comes to the kitchen. Then I make like I fixed the problem, and we leave.


Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.


The old lady won’t know she’s been robbed. The next time she looks for the money and it’s gone, she won’t think that it might have been the city electric guy. She’s old. If she does remember us, she sure as hell won’t remember what we looked like.


Randy says there’s about six thousand dollars there. I’m like, how do you know? He says the old lady is Dexter Lockwood’s granny and Dexter told him. We gotta give Dexter some of the money? Randy says no, that Dexter is stupid and just told this without thinking up the plan hisself.


Randy is staying in the van while Debbie and me go inside. With the weather as cold as it is, it wouldn’t be a good idea to turn the thing off and just hope it will start when we get back. It’s usually reliable, but in this weather? I don’t know. I’m leaving it running with Randy inside, out of sight.


And damn, it is snowing. So, I drive a little slower on the way, looking around to see how many cars are out and since the snow just started, there’s quite a few.


We get to the house and it’s not what I was expecting. I thought it would be something pretty nice, but it’s not. It’s a little bit bigger than the shotgun houses in mill town, but not by much. There’s a carport full of junk and the Plymouth in the driveway looks like it hasn’t moved in a while.


I asked Randy if he was sure this was the place and he said that he was.

I parked on the street and looked over at Debbie. She’s a pretty girl, but the kind of pretty girl that knows she’s pretty. The coat she was wearing had a fur collar that she pulled up to cover a good bit of her face. She said, “Here we go.”


Part II: Debbie


When Steve pulled up in front of the house, I could tell that he was scared, and it wasn’t just because of the snow. He was dim in the head like his brother Dennis, but Dennis wasn’t scared of anything. That’s why he was locked up. A little bit of scared can be a good thing. It keeps you from being foolish.


Randy and I had gone over the plan a good bit before we got Steve involved. He had the shirt and the plain white van. He was too dumb to send in alone. Somebody needed to go with him to be sure he didn’t screw it up.


While we’re going over the plan, Steve started talking about having a gun he wanted to bring with him. Randy said no. A gun would change all of this. We would go from basically pulling a scam to maybe getting charged with assault with a deadly weapon of an old lady.


I’m scared that Steve brought it anyhow.


So, it’s below freezing, and the snow has started to stick. I didn’t say anything, though. We needed to be focused on what we were doing because this was six thousand dollars: two for each of us. I could last six months on two thousand dollars if I was careful. And I was careful.


I’m not mentioning that until we get this done. I want my money and then I’m done with Randy and with Steve and with Dennis.


When he stopped the van in front of the house, I could see Steve starting to freak out a little. I didn’t want him to spend too much time thinking so I just looked at him and said, “Here we go.” I got out of the van and started around. Randy got in the driver’s seat.


We went to the door and knocked. The old lady opened it right away, like she had been standing there waiting for us. She’s tiny. I mean, I’m only 5-2 myself, but she’s shorter than me: a tiny little old lady. “Can I help you?”


Steve stutters a little, but manages to say, “We’re here about your bill. Has it been too high lately?”


“What bill?” she says.


“The electric bill,” he says. “Has your electric bill been too high?”


“It’s high,” the old woman says, just like any other old woman would have said about any other bill.


The old lady is tiny, but she’s mad, staring at him, right in the eye.


“Let me come to your kitchen,” Steve says. “I can show you what the problem is.”


“I need to go to the bathroom,” I say, but the old lady doesn’t hear me.


The old lady looks at me and says, “They got to send two of you to look at it?”


Steve is in over his head. “Let me come to your kitchen,” he says.


The old lady’s hackles are up big-time, and I can see that’s she’s not scared. She knows we’re trouble and she’s not going to let us in. I say again, “I need to go to the bathroom.”


“I can show you where the problem is and I can fix it and save you some money,” Steve says, and he sounds desperate saying it.


I could see where this was heading. She would slam the door and call the police and even if we didn’t get caught, there wouldn’t be any money: that was for damned sure.


I shoved past Steve and pushed the old lady backwards. I thought she would fall, but she didn’t. She staggered a step, and I was inside. I spun her around and pushed her face-first into the sofa. I didn’t want her looking at us any more than she already had.


I could hear Steve snatching drawers open in the next room. I’m thinking the jerk doesn’t remember where the money is. Randy had said specifically that it was in the bottom drawer in a cardboard box under some old nightgowns. Why the hell could he not find it?


I hear him cussing then. He comes out and says, “Debbie, you’re going to have to come and look for it. I can’t find it.”


“Idiot! Names!” Now the old lady knew my name at very least.


By then he was beside me, leaning into the old woman himself, holding her there. I got up and went to the bedroom and saw that he had ransacked it. The room straight across the hall was a little bathroom. There was one other door still closed. I went to it.


I opened the door, expecting to find a different bedroom, the right bedroom, but instead it’s piled high with boxes and crap: her junk room. “Damn it,” I said.


I went back to the front room where Steve continued to hold the old lady down. I leaned down to her and said, “Where is your money?”


“I don’t have any money,” she said.


Steve started to let her up and it made me so mad that I slapped his head. He leaned back into her.


“You do. We know about it. It’s supposed to be in the bottom drawer of your chester drawers in a box. Now, where is it?”


She said, “My Christmas money?”


“Yeah,” I said wondering if she thought we wouldn’t take it if she called it that.


“It’s gone. I spent it.”


Now I was mad. How did Randy get such bad information? What the hell were we going to do now? Finally, I said, “You must have started saving up again for next Christmas. Where’s that at?”


“In my sewing room,” she said.


I didn’t say anything to that.


“The sewing room,” she said. “I heard you opening doors. I know you went in there.”


“The room with the boxes?”


“Yeah, I keep it in one of the boxes in there.”


“Which one?”


She started describing where it was, but I thought there was no way I was going to go in there and find it even with her description. There was crap everywhere in that room.


“Bring her down here, Jeff,” I said, heading down the hall and expecting Steve to understand that I was referring to him. Again, it took two beats for him to catch on.


He held the old woman by the back of her neck, pushing her in front of him. I pulled my coat up high enough that she couldn’t get a good look at my face. When she got inside the room, she went to a stack of boxes and moved them around, finally pulling out one that looked – to me, at least – like every other box in the room. She fumbled and opened it as we stood behind her.


Part III: Randy


There was supposed to be six thousand dollars in the box. If anything, I thought there might be more. I told Debbie about it, hoping she could talk Steve into doing the actual theft. Her idea was better because she knew about the official-looking shirt. I didn’t want to deal with Steve. He was stupid. This needed to be simple, not simple-minded.


Debbie planned it well. None of us knew how the weather would be that day. The temperature had been around freezing for a few days. Then it dropped into the twenties and then it started to snow. I thought about calling it off, but I didn’t want to lose Steve. We could do this.


Debbie had Steve practice everything he was going to say and do. She walked him through it over and over until we were all bored to death by it. The main thing was to say he was from the city and that there was a problem with the electricity, and he could fix it and save her money. Once they were inside, the whole thing would take two or three minutes.


I thought the shirt would be enough to make Steve look like a utility worker. It wasn’t. He looked like a doofus wearing a work shirt. It was too late for me to say anything to him or Debbie. We were committed to the plan by then. I looked at him and wanted to ask if he had brought his little gun with him, but I didn’t. I just wanted to hurry and get this over with.


When we got there, Steve is like a raccoon caught in a car’s headlights and I think, “Damn. We are done for.” I thought about pulling the plug, but I didn’t. I should have, but I didn’t.


Debbie came through, getting him out of the van and headed toward the house. I watched them till they got to the door, and I realized how much snow had fallen.


Maybe five minutes passed before I heard the gunshot. That son of a bitch had brought a gun after I told him not to. He fired again and I thought, “Dumb bastard has killed her.”


I was already out of the van – which I had left running and with the door open – and was running toward the house. I can hear Debbie crying and I know it’s because she just watched that fool kill the old woman. The door pops open and Debbie comes staggering out, doubled over.


I grab her shoulders and raise her up. There is a widening red patch at her stomach that I don’t want to look at too closely.


I put my arm under her and help her to the van. I can’t very well drive her to the hospital and explain that our partner accidentally shot her while we were robbing an old lady. And I can’t walk away from that situation either, I realize.


I opened the side door and laid her down. “This is messed up,” I said. She didn’t say anything back.


I ran back to the little house, knowing that neighbors might have heard the gunshots and called the police. I needed to get Steve and the money and get the hell away and figure out what we needed to do about Debbie.


I didn’t want to see the dead old lady. I didn’t. As soon as I got inside, I yelled, “Steve!”


There was no answer. I went down the little hall and looked in the bedroom, but no one was there. I started into the junk room, but I fell, slipping in blood on the floor. My feet slid from under me, and I went down hard, banging my head on the floor.


Someone spoke my name. I turned my head and saw Steve lying on the floor beside me. Blood throbbed slowly from his neck. He was not dead, but he would be soon.

I heard my name again and looked up to see the old woman standing above me, her face filled with anger and sadness.


“Randy,” she said. Then I saw that she was holding the old Colt pistol that had belonged to my grandfather. I didn’t realize she still had it. I should have, but I didn’t.


“Hey, Grandma,” I said.

    description:`Date: 06/13/2079. Time: 10:10. File number: 698278. Defendant's name: 698278. Crime: Producing and spreading false news, undermining the unity and solidarity of the state, and slandering the Holy Leader."


The case details were read aloud, and a weak, muffled voice began to speak.


"Dear people of X. Once again, we gathered for an important case. The defendant, 698278, who was recently apprehended, has been found guilty of spreading countless lies against our Holy Leader and his esteemed colleagues since the Dark Years. As you know, lying, and undermining state unity are among the greatest sins condemned by God, especially when targeting a great leader. However, I want to remind you once again, that God has blessed us with the most merciful leader, who has granted everyone the right to seek forgiveness. Now, we shall begin the Purification Court of the defendant, 698278. Defendant, are you ready to admit your quilt and apologize?"


This was the first time I’d been addressed since entering the freezing courtroom. As the thick black blindfold was lifted, I tried to grasp what was happening, but when it was finally removed, I thought I'd gone blind. I was still swallowed by an endless darkness.


It must have been the drugs, I thought, or the endless interrogations I’d endured over the past weeks. But it was probably neither, because moments later, my vision slowly began to return, and shapes started to form.


I froze.


What is that? I thought. There was a giant man in front of me.


Was that real? Had the drugs finally driven me mad, I wondered? Could be; I knew they’d done it before. But after a few seconds, I realized that wasn’t the case—at least, not for me. As my eyes fully adjusted, the world around me came into sharp focus.


The 'giant man' was actually a strange podium, rising with hundreds, maybe thousands, of people. It resembled the lecture halls I’d seen when education still held value, but instead of sloping backward, the levels were stacked vertically, forming a towering structure of men in suits.


So this was the courtroom I’d heard about so many times. I was standing within a wooden frame, flanked by two men in white uniforms with concealed faces. A web of cables was attached to my body, and in front of me, a strange, deep emptiness stretched out.


"Respond to the judge!"


A sharp pain throbbed in my head. The judge, I thought. Which one was he? And what was I supposed to say? It wasn’t easy to pick out one thought from the billions swirling in my mind for years. As I scanned the faces in front of me, all with the same unreadable expression, one man at the top of the giant shape caught my attention.


His gaze seemed fixed on something behind me, evident from the slight tilt of his head. My eyesight, dulled from years of hiding, couldn’t make out his face, but I sensed something unsettling about him.


I turned and glanced at the wall. Of course, I thought. A giant poster of the president.


It was the one president had made ten years ago when he took charge after covering up all his crimes, promising to "bring democracy to the country." He'd ordered it to be displayed everywhere, and anyone who didn’t show proper respect for it was arrested and imprisoned.


The Purification Courts were the final step, and I knew many had ended up there. TV channels claimed that 'confused' individuals were 'purified' and reintegrated into society, but no one really knew the truth. The president silenced anyone who spoke out against him, and with all opposing views suppressed, the news became meaningless. As one of the few who had tried to speak the truth in a society of parrots, I understood this better than anyone.


I didn’t bow my head. I wasn’t here for that. I’d already made my decision years ago, and I could predict the outcome. This was probably my last chance to speak, and I was going to use it to shout the truth.


When I turned, I knew exactly who I was facing.


"Lower your head, defendant! Know your place!" the judge commanded.


Where is this man? I thought. Then I saw him: a small man with a microphone, wearing a faded and torn judge's robe, barely recognizable. He was sitting at the very bottom of the podium, right at the foot of the giant man. I wasn’t surprised.


“The recordings and witnesses show you committed severe crimes to undermine the state's integrity, continuing until your capture. We will review your actions, and you will have the chance to defend yourself. As everyone knows, freedom of thought and the right to defend oneself are cherished rights in our country, upheld by our Holy Leader.”


Freedom of thought, huh? I thought, suppressing a laugh. But when I glanced at the crowd sitting to my left, labeled ‘Audience,’ something stopped me. It was my mother.


When the president began imprisoning journalists and opposition members, I had to hide. At first, my mother visited, but eventually, the visits stopped. I never asked why, and after I moved, we never saw each other again. Twelve years, I thought. It had been twelve years since I last saw her. I spent those years believing justice would prevail and that one day, I'd reunite with my mother and loved ones. But after all this time, this was where we met: the Purification Courts.


Don’t worry, Mom, I wanted to say. Everything will be fine. But I couldn’t make a promise I knew I couldn’t keep.


Do not let it distract you, I told myself, thinking through my plan. Then I repeated the phrase that had sustained me for weeks, months, and years: “You can never know when and where a single piece of truth can destroy a whole lie.”


As I stared at my mom, she slowly turned her head. Considering my condition, it must have been difficult for her to look at me, I thought. Still, I was feeling a strange unease settle in my chest.


“Our Holy Leader has given everyone the right to be reborn and cleanse themselves of their sins," the judge continued. "What you need to do is admit your crimes, repent, and sincerely apologize."


Sincerely... I knew what that meant.


"Do you know what the wires connected to your body are?"


I swallowed. I'd heard many things about the Purification Courts. It was the president's greatest weapon, labeling those with moral values as "sinners in need of purification," all while reinforcing his image as a merciful leader. You would be forgiven if you apologized sincerely, but punished if you failed to do so. The punishment was clear, though no TV channel openly discussed it. Still, a few people, risking their lives, managed to bring the truth to light.


A high-tech lie detector, right beneath the giant man, was the vital organ of this court. One day, the president celebrated the invention of this machine on television, with a team of 50 engineers who had created it. Just one week after the celebration, the whole engineering team died in a tragic fire.


What I couldn’t understand was how, with hundreds of spectators at every trial, no one spoke out. This meant no one was protesting these decisions. There must have been protests, I thought. And he must have covered them up, too. Could people really stay silent while their neighbors and families were being eliminated? But if the public had reacted, would we have reached this point? I silenced the voice inside me.

All they needed was to hear the truth one more time.


I was about to speak, but the judge continued, “The wires will show if you're lying or truthful. The one around your neck will punish you if you persist in your sins.”


 I traced my hand over the thick cord around my neck. The deep void in front of me now made sense. Medieval, I thought. I wasn’t surprised. I was waiting to hear something about the wires on my temples, but the explanations stopped.  


“Do you understand everything, 698278?'"


The judge spoke so calmly, it was as if he were reciting cheap lines from a cheap play. He didn’t waste any time and looked at the pile of papers in front of him.


"Crime One: You worked for a newspaper, which was later purified and renamed 'Only the Truth.' You wrote defamatory articles accusing Our Holy Leader of various crimes. All of your former colleagues testified that you made these false accusations and wrote baseless articles. Do you admit your sins?"


As I listened, I remembered a warning my friend had given me while we were writing down the president’s crimes on small papers to spread to the people: "We’re doing this today, but if you ever get caught, don’t protest. No truth is more important than your life. Especially in this country, for these people." He had been caught two years ago. I wondered what he had said in court. Had he lied?


I won’t do that, I said, looking at the president fidgeting at the top. Even if I couldn't topple this giant, I wouldn’t be one to support it. I took a deep breath, looked at my mother and said,


"No. I do not accept any of the charges you’ve made. I only wrote the truth." My words caused a strange hum to rise in the courtroom.


"Pardon?" the judge said, raising an eyebrow.


"Are you saying you still believe our Supreme Leader is..." He tilted his head back as if it might snap, then brought his hands together, as if to apologize for what he was about to say, "...a thief and a liar?"


"I’m not saying I believe that," I said. "It is the truth!"


"If there is no evidence, then there is no truth to speak of," the judge said, his eyes narrowing as he stared me down.


"Yes, right now there’s no evidence because you destroyed it all. All the evidence you destroyed clearly showed how much of a thief the president is!" I turned to the audience. "You witnessed everything, too! Please, open your eyes—"


A sharp pain suddenly shot through my head, making me lose every word I had in my head.


I hadn’t expected this. It felt like a sword driving through the center of my brain, shredding everything inside. When I opened my eyes in pain, I saw something in the president’s hand, extending toward me. It looked like a remote control. With a grim face, he whispered something to those around him, and the whispers spread downward, the last reaching the judge.


"Very well. The interrogation is over," the judge said. "Since you persist in your slanders, you’ve lost your right to free speech. We’ll move directly to the purification session. Your mind is filled with poison and lies, so we’ll now tell you the truth. This is the last grace Our Holy Leader has granted to you."


I was still writhing in pain. I looked at my mother. She was listening to the judge, her hands folded over her chest.


"After each piece of information, I will give you a chance to speak, and you will apologize. Don’t try to say anything else. You won’t be able to, even if you want to," the judge added. As he finished speaking, the courtroom was bathed in bright red light. I tried to shield my eyes with my hand but couldn’t stop staring at my mother. How could she look so calm?


“When you claimed Our Holy Leader is a thief, you cited his golden palace and vast wealth, accusing him of stealing from the people. The truth is: The possessions of a nation’s leader reflect the reputation of the state. Our Supreme Leader has made these expenditures for the good of the people, not for himself. Moreover, a real citizen should even be willing to go hungry for the sake of their country."


The judge spoke so quickly that it made me anxious as I waited for a chance to speak. Finally, when he paused, I was about to respond, but instead, he continued. " When you claimed…” I was stunned. He was repeating the same words over and over. After the tenth repetition, he turned to me. "Do you admit your mistake and apologize?"


“Now!” I told myself, taking a deep breath and bracing for the pain, I opened my mouth.


"I'm sorry."

I paused, not believing my ears, then repeated,


"I'm sorry."


 I covered my mouth with my hands. What was happening? No matter what I said, all that echoed in the courtroom were these two words. A terrible fear gripped me as the judge's words made sense: “Don’t try to say anything else. You won’t be able to, even if you want to.” As I touched the wires on my head, I saw the lie detector flashing harsh red lights.


"It’s not accepted," the judge said. "You are not sincere." Then, he began reading again.


"You claim the president violated and changed the constitution. However, the truth is: The president has amended and improved the outdated and flawed constitution for the benefit of the people, which makes it a blessing for us, not a crime."


After the tenth repetition, he asked again.

I didn’t know what to do. I wanted to scream at the audience, at my mother, “I’m not apologizing! You know I’ve done nothing wrong! Why are you looking at me like that, mom?”


 But instead, a series of apologies kept pouring out of my mouth.

All my hopes of using this court as my last chance to speak the truth were shattered because I couldn’t control the words coming out of my mouth anymore. So, when the judge asked for the third time, I opened my mouth and said, “God damn you.”


The words I heard no longer surprised me.


After each of my responses, the room would fill with a blinding red light and a disturbing sound. It felt like this sound was only bothering me, as the audience watched with relaxed faces. I tried not to look at my mother’s side anymore; a voice inside me told me that if I did, I’d break down.


The same cycle repeated: the judge listed the crimes the president had committed and I had reported before, explaining how they were not crimes and highlighting the greatness and innocence of the president. After each one, he would turn to me, asking me to apologize. And with each time, the red light flashed, and he moved on to the next item.


"Your apology will not be accepted unless it is sincere," the judge repeated.


As I stood there, I struggled to understand the point of this absurd interrogation. They knew I had always chased the truth, as a journalist, no matter what. They knew I hadn't changed my mind, which was why I was here. So, what was the purpose of these pointless explanations and demands for an apology, knowing it wouldn’t change anything?


Without waiting my turn, “End this nonsense", I said.


The judge laughed: "Don’t bother trying to say anything else. Whatever you say, you will only be able to apologize. I told you."


A light flickered in my mind and I looked at the audience.


They knew, I thought. They knew they were controlling my voice. My eyes scanned them quickly. None of them wore wires.


As the judge spoke, I kept watching them and noticed something I hadn’t before. After each sentence, they nodded in perfect harmony, with the same confident demeanor—my mom included.


"Our Holy Leader has never had journalists or opposition figures executed. They are sinners sent by the devil." Up and down. "Our Holy Leader has never filled government positions with relatives. Each person earned their position through intelligence." Up and down. "Our Holy Leader has never silenced free speech. The shut-down channels and newspapers were spreading fake news." Up and down.


Again and again.


This wasn’t for me, I thought.

This interrogation, this “purification,” was never meant for me. It had never been. I lifted my head and looked at the little man at the top, and another truth became clear. It wasn’t you either. This wasn’t your creation. Not yours alone. Why had it taken me so long to see that?


The questioning continued at its relentless pace. I wanted to laugh, but only tears fell from my eyes. The lie detector, the rows of men before me, the deep void—none of it mattered anymore. I kept staring at the audience, at my mom. I was feeling something break inside me. As if someone had ripped away something I had hidden and nurtured inside me for years, leaving me alone with a vast emptiness.


They nodded after every word, their faces now holding a strange expression. Not pity, not hatred. It was more like, “You deserve this. Let’s see what happens now.”


“Defendant 698278. Do you admit your crime and apologize?”


Defendant 698278, I repeated.  698,278 times this court had convened, 698,278 people judged, 698,278 praises for the president’s mercy, and... 698,278 nods.


Up and down.


Then I started laughing, uncontrollably, hoping it would fill the emptiness inside me.




 “You’re not sorry, are you?” the judge said with anger, after finishing all his lines.


“No,” I replied. Actually, “I’m so sorry.”


I prepared myself for one final step. There was only one thing left to do. For myself. For what I believed.


Forgive me, God, I said. "I am so sorry." And, I closed my eyes.


However just as I lifted my foot to take a step, a sound filled the entire hall.


It was applause.


 I was taken aback and opened my eyes. Everyone was standing and clapping, and the entire courtroom was bathed in green.


Idiots, I said as I laughed harder. Bunch of idiots.`

    description:`Middle carriage. The one I enjoy most and the one people avoid most. There must be a widespread belief that the middle is the busiest. Life’s examples of Bell curves, I suppose. The train pulls up, so I take my waiting spot on the platform like a responsible citizen. I feel my armpits sweaty, so I keep my arms close, just in case.

The breaks are applied, and I’m perfectly aligned with the door. Years of the same job, same route, same carriage work wonders. Sometimes I play mental games to measure how far I am from the split between the doors. The distance I was away by most was 10 inches, ever since I started counting. One horrible mistake I never repeated.


The doors open, and after letting people get off, I make my way in when a zoned-out weirdo who probably just remembered this is his stop shoves into me on his way out.

“Sorry mate,” he says.

“No bother,” I say. I was bothered.

I take my seat next to the window panel. The middle couch's left panel is on my right as I walk inside. 66% of the time, this is free. 10% of the time is that bellend from two stops before that does in at the same hours I do on Wednesdays. He always works on his laptop on his way in and huffs and puffs to, I guess, show people how stressed he is. Something conditioned him to think that being stressed signifies higher status. Well, he’s not in today, so I take my seat.

The train starts moving and it’s the usual faces. Three, at most, tourists take space for six people with their suitcases. That young rebel teenager sitting just a bit differently to not seem a conformist. The co-workers talk about their past evenings with their spouses when deep down they want to rip their clothes off and fuck like no tomorrow. Maybe they will act on that one day, or perhaps one will move jobs, and the fantasy is over.


The next stop is Earl’s Court. Please mind the gap.


This one is always full. Two ladies walk in wearing long summer dresses and stand before me holding the rail. One of them keeps giving me occasional glances, as to suggest that perhaps I should make room. No.

“So anyway Cheryl, I told him – do you really think he’s the right man for the job?” says the blonde one.

“No, tell me. What did he say?” says Cheryl.

I watch this like a game of tennis. I feel like they know I’m eavesdropping, but they don’t mind. Something tells me they’re both used to attention.

“Give the man a chance! That’s what he said. I couldn’t believe it, Cheryl!”

“Girl, say no more,” says Cheryl.

“I’m not saying one more thing!” she said, saying.


I turn my head to the geezer on my right. Old gent with a thick black and silver beard. He's scrolling on his phone, and there are plenty of pictures from the Olympics. Every once and again, there’s a gymnast that pops up, captured perfectly for a gaze of the ass cheeks to which he zooms in. He catches me looking at his phone, to which he elbows me friendly.

“Watcha’say brother,” he asks with a devilish look. Do you reckon I could do something to her if I were a few more decades younger?”

“I doubt you’d have that flexibility, mister,” I try to respond cynically, to which he slightly turns away, scrolling continuously.


The next stop is Gloucester Road. Please mind the gap.


The tube gets more packed. The sweat is dripping ever so slightly on the sides of my body. Cheryl left what’s her name, who’s still eyeing me out, alone. This slim brunette walks in, wearing a tight black bodysuit that compliments her figure fully. I wonder if earlier in life, should I have chosen a different path, I might’ve bagged one like her. Maybe if I looked after myself better, ate my veggies, hit the gym, that kind of thing. All I am now is a slightly overweight fuck, with a baldy patch and sweat dripping on my ribs. I bet her SUV is in the garage today, and she is forced to take the tube with the commoners. That’s what I am. A commoner. Never above average, only slightly below. I was content with that, and I never thought I’d find a higher purpose. I never expected one.

What’s her name moves her feet closer to me and stubs her toe on my work bag.

“Auch! What do you have in there? Bricks?” she asks rhetorically.

I apologise. To which she insists on carrying on.

“You know what, love, you could’ve offered me a seat. I’m pregnant.”

I examine her from head to stubbed toe. She doesn’t look like it.


The next stop is South Kensington. Please mind the gap.


“No – I don’t think you are,” I say to the revolt of the nearby passengers. “Where is the badge?”

The old lad next to me gets up, feeling a chance to score a point with the ladies.

“Here you go, darling, take mine.” He says chivalrously.

She thanks him and sits next to me. More people come in, and it’s a group of primary schoolchildren at this time. Oh no, I say to myself—hopefully, just a few stops.


They start making noise and cheering the train up. This is one of those situations where 50% of people hate their guts, whilst 50% are smiling and thinking of their children and whatever happy thoughts they get from seeing these minions taking up space. One such minion points at me. He has round glasses and looks a bit weird. He keeps pointing but doesn’t say anything. I get my workbag and hug it closer to my chest. I feel like he’s got something to do with it.

I was his age once. I had dreams and aspirations. Until this system, which claims to be meritocratic, shows its ugly face at every turn. It’s all about who you know, whose ass you’ll kiss, how rich you were born – all that jazz. The hardest-working people are the poorest. Every politician loves them and praises them when it’s election time but fuck me would they actually do something to ease up their life. I’ve still got 25 years left on my mortgage, and now, with the divorce making sure I remain indebted forever, I have no extra power to pay it off. Bet that hot brunette knows nothing about a mortgage. Those designer clothes and shoes, not to mention the thick sunglasses in the underground, tell me all I need to know.


The next stop is Knightsbridge. Please mind the gap.


I see Cheryl’s friend texting next to me.

Never taking the tube again. People R weir. LOL

I agree. The co-workers in front of me are having a proper laugh. Probably some story from work drinks, and Oh! She rests her hand on his knee. That’s it. They are going to fuck soon. The kids get off, thankfully, and the weird one waves to me. Doesn’t say anything again. I wave back.


One of the adverts on the top panel talks about retirement investing. What a joke. The way things are going, most people my age would be lucky if they even retire. Negative population trends, a job market in decline, and a wild system run for its shareholders. The tourists are making their way in between the seats, and their suitcases keep hitting my knee.

“Do you mind?” I say in an aggressive tone.

“Aw, sorry, sir!” says one of them. “Apologies.”


The next stop is Hyde Park Corner. Please mind the gap.


Thank fuck. After a couple more stops, this will all be over. To my right, there’s some argument brewing. A young lady is filming a man with a large backpack.

“I told this guy, yeah.” She says, addressing the phone and pointing at the guy, “to take his backpack down ‘cause it keeps smacking me in the face, yeah, and he won’t do it. Are you dizzy?”

The man looks at her and wants to say something but realises the battle is lost before it even begins. He takes his backpack off and looks at it with a bowed head.

“What? What you got to say?” she keeps pressing him. He refuses to engage. As most tube arguments, it naturally dies down with a few people chiming in “Leave it, it’s not worth it, hun.”


I check my watch. It’s almost there. Many more people get off. Many more come in.


The next stop is Green Park. Please mind the gap.


A flashback of memories goes through my head. My childhood, my wife, my mother's funeral. The joy, the angst, the anger. Precious memories and memories I wish I could’ve erased, pressing so hard on my soul and making me a miserable man, almost 35, with no real prospects. It feels like I’ve missed that one train to happiness, but I keep catching the same one taking me to a shitty cubicle, with sweat now almost close to my buttocks. There’s no more space to move now. It is absolutely jam-packed. This is what we wanted, to travel like sardines, get a wage, and say we’re living. Living.


A man gets up from his seat and reaches the door, pushing people sideways. He drops his newspaper on the floor at my feet.


The next stop is Piccadilly Circus. Please mind the gap.


Ah, Piccadilly—tourist heaven. It is one of the busiest undergrounds and areas in London. This is my stop, coming up.

I checked the newspaper's front page. Greg Butterknocks won the election with a sweeping majority. The far-right leader will receive the King's blessing later today.

That scum. I can’t believe how many he tricked. We need a big shake-up. We can’t let him take reign and ruin this country. I check my clock. It’s almost time.

Maybe this is the right thing. Or perhaps it isn’t. I guess I’ll never know. I get my bag and feel its heaviness in my whole body now. I feel light, and the bag presses me hard in my seat. I started breathing fast without realising it, sweating all over my face, and Cheryl’s mate was checking on me now. I look at my watch again, and here it is.


10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5…

“Mate, what’s in that bag?” says what’s her name with a petrified look on her face.

…3, 2, 1.


It’s quick. I feel hot, and then I feel nothing. Silence at last. `

    description:`[Trigger Warning: Contains mentions of substance abuse (alcohol), some gore/threats of physical violence]


As Delia looked around the room she knew this night would be long. Dad had already started drinking, 'How Deep Is Your Love” blaring from the old speaker. She found her place on the side of the dining table and prepared a plate. Thanksgiving was the only time they ever ate together, her siblings would soon file in the home. Denise, Mary, and Josh. 


“Sooo how’s school going?” Denise awkwardly asked. “Good” Delia replied. That was a lie. School was not going “good”. Ever since Philip passed it become harder and harder to focus on school, much less care about it. How do you explain to your family that there is a black hole growing inside of you, threatening to swallow you up? Days are starting to blur together, and you’re starting to wonder when was the last time you told them anything other than “good”. But who cares. That would only start a fight. It’s easier to feign indifference when it’s all you know. Or all you can remember. Maybe this topic would be best reserved for Christmas. “Can you pass the potatoes” Mom says. The evening drifted along, short stories exchanged, laughter floating along in spurts carrying Dad’s drunken happiness. Delia simply observed. That is, until she heard a knock on the door. 


“Who’s that?” Mary asked. “I didn’t invite anyone else?” Denise replied. Delia quickly rose, curious to see. She glanced through the peephole, seeing a blonde woman. “It’s some lady” she turns to the others gauging to see what she should do. Seeing no disapproving reactions, she opens the door. “Hi I’m Mallory. I’m really hungry and I was wondering if you could spare some food or maybe some change?”. Outside stood a short thin woman, with long blonde hair. She was disheveled, wearing only a stained tee and shorts that looked cut from jeans. As Delia glanced her up and down she noticed the sores and bruises covering her entire body. “Oh um just give me one second okay?” Delia said quickly closing the door behind her. “It’s some lady. She says her name is Mallory. I’m pretty sure she’s homeless, she’s asking for food.” “I might have $20 in my pocket let me check” Josh chimed in. “What no? let's invite her in she’s probably tired and hungry” Dad said. “Dad we can’t just invite a stranger in the house, are you crazy?” Mary replied. “C’mon it’s Thanksgiving isn’t this what Jesus wanted?”. “I’m pretty sure Jesus was Christmas, but same deal” Delia quipped. They looked at one another unsure of what to do. This wasn’t too far out of the realm of Dad’s giving nature, a giving nature that appears 7 beers into the night. Would it be so crazy to invite her? Denise thought. Without discussing it further he paced to the door. “Mallory you are welcome in my home, have a seat we’ll feed you”. “Oh god bless you thank you!”. She joins the table receiving a healthy portion of mashed potatoes, turkey, and sweet potato pie. This was starting to become a very interesting Thanksgiving. 


Delia couldn’t help but feel unsettled by the woman’s presence. Joining in on familial small talk was already difficult, and now this woman is glancing at her incessantly as if she knows something Delia does not. “Okay I finished I’m gonna go to my room” Delia announced. Before she could get up to leave a fork clangs against the tile floor. “Seriously Delia”. It’s Denise. Her eyes wild with anger. “What” Delia asks dumbly. “You do this every time, can you not be around us for more than five minutes?”. Delia knew this voice. She was daring her to answer. “What is your problem I said I was done”. Wrong answer. “Denise just stop” Mary said weakly. “No I’m tired of her bullshit, she doesn’t appreciate this meal we just sat down to eat, and she’s already leaving. It’s Thanksgiving”. The flames in her eyes are rising. Mallory is watching with a smile on her face. This ping pong match of two. “Like this day is different than any other day?”. Really wrong answer. “What’s that supposed to mean?”. “You know what I mean”. "No Delia I really don’t. Why don’t you explain it to me”. Delia tried to swallow her anger, but it unleashed like a dam. Her eyes rose to her sisters, eager to match the flames. 


“You don’t know me okay! and I don’t know you so let’s not pretend like everything is cool and happy. Dad’s already drunk. And I’m tired of being the only one who sees what’s wrong with us.” You’re always putting me down”. The words come out rushed, even Delia is unsure where they’ve come from. As if a sleeping bear has been awoken. A bear that was poked from a decades long slumber. She can’t take it back, it’s out there. The facade of “good” is gone and she’s afraid. Before either can retaliate, Mallory clears her throat. “Girls let’s not fight”. Except it’s not Mallory sitting there. It’s a beautiful woman. Blonde, with sparkling skin and a clear enticing voice. “What the fuck!” Josh shouts. What the fuck is right. 


“Well I’m an angel you see. That’s why I can change my appearance.” Mallory smiles. Delia has chills. If this is an angel, why doesn’t she feel comforted?. “I think we should settle this little squabble don’t you?.” The family looks towards each other unable to believe their eyes. “Is this real?” Mary asks. “Of course! Watch this”. Without standing, Mallory lifts a knife from the kitchen slitting her own throat. They shriek in terror. As quickly as the blood fell, they blink and it’s gone. Her neck unblemished as it was before. “Now I think we should get to the root of things. A little family intervention”. Denise and Delia are pushed back into their seats. They try to get up but can’t. “Now Delia what’s the matter?.” Mallory pouts. Delia look at Mallory with the same fire. She raises the knife again. This time pointed towards Delia. “I would answer if I was you.” She smiles. Delia looks at her sister. “I just feel like you don’t take me seriously or care to. When have you asked how I feel without criticizing me for something. I know I failed okay. I know I’m not you.” Tears begin to fall from her eyes. Embarrassed she looks away. For a second Denise stops to think. Delia can see a glimmer of softness, but then. “I don’t criticize you okay? You’re the one who makes it difficult for us to be together. You are ungrateful. Look at how you treat Mom and Dad”. Mallory laughs delighted. 


“How do I treat Mom and Dad?” Delia scoffs. "Dad is the one who treats her like shit. Every time they end up fighting, he calls her stupid, forgetful, he belittles her, and I have been the one who’s gone out to try to defend her. He can never apologize”. Delia exclaims, pleading for someone at the table to agree. Josh and Mary lower their gaze. Now it’s Denise who is crying. “Dad didn’t have an easy life okay, but he gives you everything! Everything you have is because of him. You have no idea Delia.” “Well maybe that isn’t what I wanted”. A final blow. “I should just forgive him for that and forget? Why should I? I’m not you.” Delia can see the pain spreading across Denise’s face. She knows she should stop, but she can’t it’s already too late. But in her eyes she can see, a small part of Denise agrees too. 


“See now we’re getting somewhere!” Mallory states. “Two sisters who differ in their feelings towards their parents, and how they’ve affected them.” Delia looks at Mallory. She’s reveling in their anger, her eyes brightening. “Is she actually enjoying this? Delia thinks. “Now Denise”. She motions to the knife now pointed towards her head. “Your turn”. 


“Delia I know Dad hasn’t been the best to you, he wasn’t the best to us either. And if you think he was bad before, when we were young he was way worse." Josh and Mary look up at their sister nodding their heads. “She’s right” Mary said. “But people change Delia.” Delia looks away, this isn’t what she wants to hear. The fire in Denise’s eyes is gone now. “You are right. And I’m sorry I made you feel unheard. You don’t have to forgive. But. I hope for the sake of us, you do”. Her voice is pleading, as are her eyes. “Match me Delia. Please.” she thinks. Delia looks at her, unsure. A glimmer of softness peeks out. She does. 


“You’re not an angel” Delia says to Mallory. Mallory gasps feigning ignorance. “Of course I’m an angel, you saw what I can do. You all saw”. She looks around the table, the eyes of the family following her. Anger, Sadness, Confusion, Fear, Brokenness. “Angels don’t want to watch people suffer.” Delia says defiantly. She can see a hint of fear in Mallory’s eyes. “You lie!” Mallory shrieks. “You will never coincide with them! Think of what they said to you Delia.” “I have.” Delia replies. Her fire reignited. “It’s time for you to leave DEMON.” Delia spits the word out. She looks across the table at Denise. They're both crying, but the tears aren't sad. With the confidence one only gets from the words they whisper to themselves in private darkened rooms. She says with complete conviction “I love you”. A phrase she hasn’t remembered saying in years. Mallory quickly vanishes into thin air, her shrieks echoing as she becomes nothing. The room fell silent. No more words needed to be said between the two. The family continues their Thanksgiving dinner. `

    description:`One thing people often miss about life is that preparation is key. It’s all about planning. Getting each detail right. It makes all the difference. If you plan carefully, you succeed. It’s that simple. Whether it’s a big project or just a daily routine, being ready sets you apart.


"One venti brown sugar oat milk iced latte," she mutters, her eyes shackled to her phone. Bad-mannered, I think. It's a glimpse into the core of someone's soul- how they treat those serving them. It separates her kind from mine. She flicks her phone over the card reader, oblivious to anyone but herself. I lean closer and watch as she briskly taps her payment through, then slips into her emails.


"Name for the order?" the barista asks, lifting a hand to her visor to adjust it as it slowly shifts down her forehead.  


“Amanda,” she says, eyes still glued to her phone.  


I wonder why she lied. Every visit here this month, a new alias. Sometimes, she’s Ramona. Sometimes Samantha. Never Sarah. Is it a game? A brief escape from herself?


I order next. "Tall black coffee." No frills. It needs to be quick.


I stand behind her again in the pick-up line. She doesn’t notice when they shout Amanda. But why would she? It isn’t her name. Absorbed in her screen, her brow furrowed. She snaps back to reality only at the call of the oat milk latte.


"Becky," they call just as she sips her drink.  Our shoulders brush as I reach for my coffee. I’m not sure if it was on purpose or not. Maybe it was. Her touch sends a jolt of electricity through my body.


“Sorry,” I say to her, but she doesn’t notice the touch. Or me. She never does. She never has.


She pivots toward the door, her form melting into the bustling street. I'm right behind her, just a shadow among many. With its teeming sidewalks and endless distractions—phones glued to hands—this city's a stalker’s paradise. You could be followed for blocks, and you’d never know it.


It’s a wonder more people aren’t struck by cars. I've watched countless times as distracted pedestrians dance with traffic. Phones in faces. Oblivious. Reckless.


She’s on her way to work, ten blocks down, a luxury for a New Yorker. Her new proximity to the office is a rare privilege here. Some days she works from their home—though never on Mondays. Mondays are sacred, reserved for the chaos of new beginnings and piled-up tasks.


Later, she'll drift into Whole Foods, her routine unchanging. There, she’ll walk out with just a single bag of groceries—its cost likely surpassing what I spend on six bags at my local grocer. Her choices are always impeccably upscale: organic steaks, fresh corn on the cob, plump tomatoes. She enjoys cooking for him on Monday nights. I've noted his favorite items progressing along the conveyor belt at the checkout line, week after week. I wonder if she actually enjoys these foods or if she simply prepares what he prefers.


She raises her phone to her ear and begins to talk. I can only make out snippets of her conversation. A tangle of taxi horns and distant shouts muffle her words. Meet you tomorrow at seven. Dos Caminos on Broadway. I miss you too.


She's talking to him. Her pitch skyrockets, a telltale octave above her usual. Reserved for him. Perhaps he prefers the chirpier tones. Maybe my voice, a deeper alto, never quite matched his taste. He disliked my practicality, too—said I made everything a calculation, devoid of spontaneity. And then there was my cooking; he joked that I could burn water.


Or maybe it’s her laugh. Carefree. Infectious. A sharp contrast to my cautious smiles. She dances through life, light and unburdened. Everything I wasn't. Maybe that’s the sparkle he needed. The lightness. Maybe that’s why.


He’s been out of town since last week. He travels a lot. At least once a month. She must miss him terribly. A whole week, all by her lonesome. She's been dining with friends for dinner instead of with him. Substituting midday treadmill runs instead of their usual lunch dates. I think it’s probably good for them both—the distance. My mother always said that distance makes the heart grow fonder. My mother claimed it fueled desire. Maybe it does. Or maybe it just makes you forget.


She stops in front of a store, her gaze locked on the display through the window. I decelerate, maintaining a discreet distance—three storefronts behind. I mimic her, pretending to scrutinize a neighboring shopfront with equal intensity. It's a pet store, previously unnoticed by me. Chic leashes dangle next to whimsically shaped dog toys behind the glass, exuding an air of exclusivity. The prices, no doubt, are beyond my reach.


Her laughter pierces the air, drawing my attention back. I watch from the corner of my eye as she pushes open the glass door and disappears inside. I edge forward, anticipating the usual high-end fashion boutiques she frequents—Chanel or Prada. But as I near, my assumptions shatter against the unexpected sight.


Instead of luxurious accessories with exorbitant price tags, the window reveals an array of baby items. Booties. Bibs. A sleek, modern pram. Each item catches me completely off guard. The pieces of a new puzzle slowly click into place.


I peer through the window, my eyes fixated on Sarah as she sifts through a rack of baby clothes. The phone is abandoned now, a serene smile playing across her face. Jealousy gnaws at me, tightening its grip as she shares a laugh with the saleswoman. My hand instinctively brushes my belly, finding only the echo of emptiness.


I wonder if he knows yet. Or maybe she’s planning on surprising him at Dos Caminos tomorrow night. Perhaps she’s crafted a creative surprise—tucking the pregnancy test into a quaint gift box for him to discover. Or maybe it’s a tiny onesie she’ll hand over, her eyes sparkling with the news. She must be brimming with excitement, each giggle and glance weaving her deeper into the new life she's crafting with him—a life I'm not a part of.


I clutch my purse, pressing firmly against its contents. The familiar weight of the gun inside sends a rush of relief coursing through me.

It's a shame, really. She'll never experience motherhood. I almost feel bad for her.


My gaze finally breaks from her, and I turn away, blending into the crowd towards the subway. It's time to pack, to prepare. I'll make myself at home in her place, just for the day. I've been there before, under a different pretext. When I was with him. This time, my visit will be far less benign. Waiting in the shadows, ready for her return. Preparation is key, after all. Always.`

    description:`Today is another anniversary of my father's death, and at the moment, I have learned about our family secret.

Then, on his deathbed, my father told me something I didn't want to know. But thus, he cleared his conscience.

He apologized for the fact that nothing could be changed. The burden of the secret had already fallen on my shoulders.


***


When I was ten, my family moved to a small town.  My father once again sold all our real estate and bought a house in a town on the other side of the country. He was a computer programmer who worked from home. That allowed us to live where we wanted, so we moved frequently. 


Our neighbors were the Evans family, the most prosperous in town. Everything was fine with them, except for the dead dogs at the front door every month. The police tried as hard as they could, but did not find those who had done it.


When I was a child, it all seemed very strange to me. Who knows what motivated people? And what evil forces took over their minds when they drew three sixes on the front door with dog's blood and went on doing it even when the family left the house for the summer?


Perhaps they were frightened by the wealth acquired by the family of an ordinary office clerk. Or was it the rumors that constantly went around about families who live so secluded? The Evans did not accept invitations to visit from their neighbors and kept guests from passing the threshold themselves. The Evans never responded to my father's attempts to get acquainted, but I sometimes ran into Mrs. Evans on the street when she got into her car. She always seemed very sad to me.


Despite people's dislike of the Evans, they were feared and did not go beyond vandalism with dogs. Several times, I saw people passing their houses secretly crossing themselves and quickening their pace.


“Mom, why does everyone hate our neighbors so much?” I asked once.


Mom, busy preparing minced meat in the kitchen, looked at me.


“Well, kid," she wiped her hand with a towel and patted me on the head. “People just think that no one can get rich for nothing.”


I was not satisfied with this answer. So I asked my school friend Andrew about the Evans. He shrugged:


“They're just weird”. Dad says they've always been like that since they arrived. Aunt Beverly thinks that the Devil himself brought them money on a silver platter.”


And somehow, I had to live with these answers, although I didn't like them. In my free time, I watched the Evans. They had two children, but they never showed up on the street, and I only saw their silhouettes in the window. Teachers came to their homes. Mr. Evans went to work every morning in his car, and Mrs. Evans sometimes went away somewhere. 


November passed, and December came. The wind whistled through the branches of the trees stronger than usual in those days and blew golden leaves along the sidewalks. Corey Anderson, my classmate, disappeared one quiet evening when he stayed late at school for practice. His family alerted the police, but Corey vanished into thin air. And Carroll Davis disappeared after him.


Now, the missing children's posters fluttered in the wind on every lamppost. Panic settled in the town, and my parents took me to and from school themselves. 


“Children often run away,” my father sighed once during dinner. “Who knows what skeletons are hiding in other people's closets?”


Mom agreed with him.


“Jimmy, finish your meal,” she nodded at the meat stew on my plate. “Otherwise, you won't get your favorite cinnamon apple pie.”


“Mom spent half the day in the kitchen,” my father said. “Don't upset her, okay?”


I didn't want to upset my mother, so I finished my dinner. She always liked to tinker around in the kitchen, and she even made her minced meat. And she was always distraught if someone didn't appreciate her efforts.


When Thomas Johnson went missing, the police began questioning all the residents of our quiet town. A policeman, Mr. Carrington, dropped in on us.


At ten years old, I still didn’t really understand how I could help the police, but I answered honestly I didn’t communicate with Corey. Carroll was older for us to be friends, and I only saw Thomas at training. And that’s how they left me alone. Mom invited Mr. Carrington to dinner. He praised Mom’s cutlets for a long time and left satisfied, and then he often dropped by to visit and tell me how things were going with the investigations of missing children.


One night, I woke up from a heavy slam of the door when my father returned from somewhere. I crept to the stairs and heard my mother ask, “Everything's okay?”


“Yes, everything is great,” my father nodded. Seeing my figure hiding in the shadows, he smiled, “Why aren’t you sleeping?”


“Dad, where have you been?” I rubbed my sleepy eyes with my fist.


“Mom wasn't feeling well, so I went to get some medicine,” he answered. "Are you in any pain? You look pale.”


I shook my head.


“Go to bed,” Mom smiled tiredly. “You have a holiday at school tomorrow, and you don't want to oversleep, do you?”


I didn't want to oversleep, and I fell asleep so soundly that even the wind and thunderstorm didn't bother me. In the morning, as I was trudging to school, I saw police cars near Evans' front door. The father of the family was being led out in handcuffs. Mr. Carrington nodded to me and gave me a thumbs up as if to say, no need to be afraid anymore; everything was fine. Already at school, I learned the latest rumors: they said that children's bones had been found in the sewer under the Evans' house. They noted that Corey's textbooks and Carroll's dress had also been found there.


Someone anonymously called the police that night and reported that they had seen Corey getting into Mr. Evans' car in the rain.


After Mr. Evans and his wife were arrested, their children were sent to a new family, and the empty house was robbed a couple of times. Police caught robbers. Robbers said they found a lot of creepy books and things there. Robbers said the Evans sacrificed children to the Devil. Robbers also said the Evans ate their corpses.


That's what they said.


***


I'm already forty-five, and I have my own family. After my father died, my family and I moved from that town to a new town on the other side of the country, and then to another town, and now we're moving again, but I still remember the story with the Evans. And now I know what the Evans family was up to; my dad explained it all to me on his deathbed. Maybe our neighbors, the Evans, had creepy books and things and even made a pact with the Devil to get rich, but none of them touched those children.


I heard my wife fussing around in the kitchen, and I smiled.


“Honey!” she calls. “Will you handle the leftovers?”


I took the trash bag from her and looked inside. Inside were a girl's blue dress, boots, and a school bag. I went out to the backyard and lit a fire.


When I was ten, I had no idea that acid was very good at dissolving bones.


When I'm on my deathbed, I'll tell my son our family secret and give him some advice. After all, he may not always be lucky with "convenient" neighbors.`
