    description:`With the mission running long and no exfil in sight, there’s little for Valerian and Roman to do besides purchase too many groceries, hole up in the safehouse, and settle old bets.

Val stands over the cracked electric stove, carefully stirring a pot of ukha. The delicate scent of herbs, spices, and freshwater fish spirals off the surface of the broth. It smells of home, and Val knows without looking that Roman is sprawled on the couch behind him.

“Just be careful not to let the salmon overcook,” Roman calls out. What would be genuine advice from anyone else, Val knows is actually a gentle rib.

He scoffs, though he doesn’t take his eyes off the pot. “I’ll win this time. You’ll see.”

“Sure,” Roman says generously. “Except you’re still missing something.”

Val inhales, letting the well-rounded scent settle around him. “You can bullshit about your ‘secret ingredient’ all you like—I know when you’re bluffing.”

Roman is grinning; Val can hear it in his tone. “Your gambling money in my pocket says otherwise. Fish about done?”

Delicately poking at one cube of salmon, Val is pleased to find it flaky, tender, and cooked all the way through. “Yeah. Come get it while it’s hot.”

He nudges the pot off the heat and dishes out two bowls. Roman plucks one from his hands and takes a preliminary sip.

“Hmm. You’re definitely close. But not quite. Still missing that all-important piece to bring it together.”

Val eats a spoonful as well, deflating as he realizes the truth. Roman is right. It’s good soup—but not as good as Roman’s. The flavors that had seemed so balanced in theory are lacking something crucial. His head dips with weary resignation. “Fine...you win. What’s the secret?”

“Not sure I should be telling just anyone,” Roman says in his loftiest tone. “How about this: a secret for a secret. You answer my question, and I’ll tell you what you’re missing.”

Val laughs and shakes his head, grinning down at his imperfect soup. “Fine, fine. Ask away.”

He turns to face Roman, and the dream becomes a nightmare.

The safehouse is broken and charred. Darkness seeps from the corners, a viscous black liquid that gathers higher and higher on the floor. And Roman—

Roman is in uniform, drenched in blood. Valerian knows it isn’t his own. Those bright eyes bore into Valerian’s, feverish, and when Roman speaks, more darkness oozes from between his teeth.

“Why didn’t you stop me, Val?”

Val jolts awake, nearly falling from his bunk as he flails against his sheets. His eyes take in details with trained expedience—rough white walls, a footlocker, a window looking out over the grey tinge of pre-morning light.

Val’s head falls against the pillow with a groan. He knows he won’t be getting back to sleep.

* * *
“Valerian.”

Val sights down his scope, not bothering to hide his scowl. “I’m busy.”

“It’s about Roman.”

Val feels his muscles tense, though the reticle over his target doesn’t so much as twitch. “What do I have to say to make you understand? I don’t need leave, I don’t need another psych eval, and I sure as hell don’t need your pity. Bastard got what was coming to him.”

Behind him, Lena crosses her arms. Val can’t see her, but he knows the sound.

“Lie to yourself all you like, but don’t you dare start lying to me.”

Valerian takes his eye off the scope to turn his head, looking up and over his shoulder at where Lena stands. Arms crossed, hips canted, exactly as he’d pictured her. “Did you come out just to bother me, or are you going to do anything useful to the Front?” he snaps. 

Lena rolls her eyes and takes out a scouter. “Wind from 31 degrees northeast. Target at 1572.8 meters out.”

Val presses his eye back to the scope of the long, lean Sovereign rifle, breathing out the frustration lingering in his muscles. The reticle settles perfectly in place, and the trigger pulls smooth as silk.

The air splits with the thunder of the Sovereign’s discharge, and Val feels the weapon kick hard against his shoulder. He doesn’t bother to check whether the shot landed as he sits up and glances back at Lena.

Her scouter is still held over her eyes, though she lowers it as Val turns toward her. “You always were the best,” she says with a touch of wryness. “Now, would you please listen?”

Val scoffs and slings the Sovereign over his shoulder. He gets to his feet, dusting some of the dirt and grit from the front of his uniform. “It’s cute when you imply I have a choice.”

Their boots crunch over rain-parched earth as they start the trek back to base. Valerian shields his eyes against the bloody sunset, content to let his brisk pace speak to his disinterest in what Lena has to say. Still, he doesn’t try to stop her when she brings up Roman again.

“The brass finally made their ruling,” she starts. Her voice is shaped cautiously, neither accusing nor exonerating. “The cave-in was officially labeled an accident. You’re off the hook, not that there ever was much doubt. Honestly, after everything Roman did, I’m a little surprised they never offered you a medal.”

Val’s pace doesn’t falter, but he can tell Lena sees the tension in his shoulders when she softens her voice.

“I don’t want to dredge it all up again; believe me, I don’t. But I thought you should know, there have been...troubling reports, from Old England. Someone who looks like him. Out in the forests.”

This time Valerian does pause. He whips around to search Lena’s face, even though he knows she’d never lie to him (or at least, never lie about Roman). “What are you saying? That he survived? I dropped fifty tons of rock on him, Lena.”

Lena spreads her hands in a gesture devoid of certainty. “They’re not substantiated claims. Just rumors. But you and I both know how potent his genmod was. A healing factor like that...”

The blistering heat of the desert fades from Val’s perception. For just a moment, he’s back in the chill of Old England’s forests, the thunder of falling stone still ringing in his ears. He’d cried, after. Sobbed like a baby, for the man Roman was and the thing he became and all the senseless loss of life he’d caused. Long after the tears ran dry, Val had stayed by the cave, too numb to leave and too scared to sift through the debris.

He feels the exact same, now. Terrified to dig further, not even knowing which alternative he’s scared of.

Eventually, he turns back towards base. He needs, suddenly and unequivocally, to sleep. A long, quiet nap curled up in his bunk sounds like exactly the thing.

“Will you go?” Lena calls after him. “Back to Old England?”

Val shakes his head without looking back. “They’d never assign me there.”

“Didn’t stop you the first time, as I recall.”

Val pretends not to hear her.

* * *
He dreams about Roman again, of course. It’s always been Roman.

Before the disastrous Operation: Crimson Thread, it was Roman’s laugh, his crooked smile, his dancing eyes. That unshakeable confidence. Arrogance, some would say. Roman’s genmod, the genetic alteration that allowed him to heal so rapidly and cleanly, was a powerful one, and he treated it like immortality. His attitude was infectious, intoxicating. Everything about the man lit Val like a fuse.

After Crimson Thread, Roman changed. His fire became feverish, secretive. He smiled less, isolated more, trained harder. He pushed his friends away. He pushed Val away.

Val fooled himself into thinking it was a temporary change, a grief response. Maybe Lena did, too. No one could have truly anticipated what Roman became.

There’s a new age dawning, Val. Can you hear the cries?

Val couldn’t. Not back then. But every night since, he’s heard them: the wails of friends, family, innocents—every life cut short by Roman’s hands, until the chorus of the damned numbers hundreds strong, every last one of them screaming inside Val’s head.

Why didn’t you stop him, Val?

* * *
Old England is cold, damp, and crawling with hostile mutations. Some are intelligent enough to form loose bands or packs; others eat each other on sight. Valerian hates the whole island with a passion.

He starts his investigation at the Lodge—one of the few bastions of sanity on this rock. It’s large as frontier settlements go, with a population somewhere in the triple digits. It also happens to host a small base for the Front, but the other Frontsmen turn out to be of little help. None of them have seen this supposed specter of Roman.

“If we did, we’d put him back in the ground, eh?” The Captain smirks. “Wish I’d been there to kill the bastard myself, but apparently some off-duty sergeant got the honors. Happened here, you know, just 20 klicks to the west.”

Valerian knows.

“Look, kid, I’ll level with you,” another officer tells him. “The locals like to report a sighting now and then, just to keep the Front’s interest. This place wouldn’t last a week without our patrols.”

“Roman Tovhana?” This soldier just shakes his head with a grin. “You’re about four months too late, my friend. Better luck next time.”

The townspeople are hardly more forthcoming. Most of them scowl and spit at Roman’s name. Some of them recall hearing a rumor about the man haunting the site of his death, but no one can remember who reported such a thing.

Val was hoping it wouldn’t come to this. But like the genmod that keeps his hands rock-steady on his weapons, he isn’t easily shaken. With a pack of supplies, his sidearm, and plenty of ammo, he heads out west towards the last place he saw Roman alive.

It takes him almost three days of unrelenting rain to find the cave again. When he does, it’s because he nearly trips over the entryway.

Loose stone shifts and skitters beneath his boots as he stumbles back. Squinting through the downpour, he can just make out the shadowy mouth of the cave behind its shroud of overgrown vegetation.

He approaches cautiously, taking in details. Trampled grass and underbrush. Small, muddy puddles about the right shape for bootprints. Someone’s been here, and recently. Maybe several someones.

That’s when he hears it, a muted echo of a voice he never thought he’d hear again.

“No! No, please, just let me go—”

Val’s lungs lock down. Like getting the wind knocked out of him in training, he can’t seem to find his breath.

Roman.

But Roman has never sounded like this. He never begged, not even staring down the barrel of a gun.

((Knew you’d be the one to find me.))

Val takes a step forward. Another. He stumbles down the uneven, natural steps of the cave, reeling as the smell of damp earth and rotting leaves brings back the memory, as clear as the rain on his skin.

((Roman’s smile. His easy posture. Val could almost convince himself, could almost believe this was his Roman, risen from the depths of madness.))

He falls against the slick stone wall of the cave, drinking deep gulps of air. He has rain in his eyes.

((But Roman’s eyes...his eyes were alight, gleaming in the beam of Val’s flashlight. Feverish.))

A new voice echoes from floor to ceiling. Laughing. “Still haven’t figured it out, have you?”

“No, wait—PLEASE!”

Roman’s scream shakes Val back to reality. That he recognizes, from a hundred reckless missions. From a terrible, thunderous rockslide.

Val’s steps quicken as he scrambles over fallen stone. Someone, he registers distantly, must have shifted enough of the wreckage to make a path.

He plunges deeper into the cave, Roman’s scream still lingering in his ears like the cutting edge of a knife. Finally, Val sees the flicker of light up ahead.

Nothing, not a single one of his fears (hopes?) prepares him for what he finds.

Roman Tovhana is alive. There’s no mistaking that proud nose, those dark eyes, the scar through his upper lip. And there’s certainly no mistaking the desperate, thrashing motions of something clawing for safety, for life.

Two strangers, a man and a woman, hold him down on his back. The man sits astride him, pinning his legs. In one hand he bears a bloody knife. Roman's clothes—long ago, a uniform—are weathered and torn, displaying the fresh, oozing wound down his chest and stomach.

“That one’s for my sister,” the man with the knife says. “This one’s for my wife—”

Valerian’s sidearm is in his hands before he’s fully pieced things together. As Roman screams again, Val levels the gun.

“Put the knife down.”

Three pairs of eyes snap towards him.

“And who the hell are you?” the woman barks.

Val’s never been so glad for his genmod, never been so fervently thankful that his gun remains steady, regardless of the storm lashing against his insides. “I’m with the Adamant Front. Care to explain what the hell you’re doing here?”

With Val serving as a distraction, Roman thrashes again, almost slipping free before the man with the knife snarls and jams the blade into Roman’s gut.

For once in his life, Val doesn’t hesitate.

The shot rings out over and over, echoing down the tunnel with the force of a cannon blast. The man formerly holding the knife howls in pain as the blade and two of his fingers spin away into darkness.

“Next one goes between your eyes,” Val hisses. “Get up. Both of you. Walk away, and never come back.”

“You bastard,” the nameless man gasps. He’s clutching the bloody remains of his right hand, trembling. “You crazy son of a— Don’t you know who this is?”

“I gave you a fucking order.” His voice doesn’t waver, even with doubt screaming in his ear like a hundred damned souls—

He doesn’t know if he’s prepared to kill these people. He doesn’t know if he could bring himself to cross that line—especially with the scenes of Roman’s murders so vivid in his mind.

Fortunately, his resolve isn’t put to the test. The man and the woman scramble upright and flee, hurrying past Val towards the mouth of the cave. Their footsteps have barely begun to fade when Val holsters his side arm and crouches down at Roman’s side.

This close, he can see the man’s a wreck. Hazy brown eyes squint up at him from a face sunken with hunger and creased from sleepless nights. His body is all angles, his torn clothing now drenched in blood.

“Hey,” Val says, and his voice comes out softer than he intends. “I need you to stay with me. There’s— I have so many questions.”

Roman’s eyes focus slowly, still narrow with pain and confusion. But clear. Lucid.

“Wh-who...who are you?”

* * *
“Here. Eat it while it’s hot.”

Val slides a bowl of ukha across the table, then settles in the other chair with his own. The delicate, complex aroma reminds him of home.

The man once named Roman Tovhana picks up his spoon and digs in. His eagerness to eat anything he doesn’t have to hunt and kill himself hasn’t waned, despite the month he’s spent in the safety of this rickety apartment.

He calls himself Rowan now, after the badly dented name he’d found on the dog tags he woke up with. It’s taken some getting used to, but Val rarely slips up. Rowan is very different from the man he once knew.

Instead of the military buzz of his predecessor, Rowan’s dark hair is long enough to flop in his eyes. He has dozens of new scars, most of which are twisted, knotted things or else deep gouges that never completely filled back in. And, of course, he no longer wears a uniform.

Neither does Valerian. The brass hadn’t known what to do with either of them, and so Val found himself quietly shuffled out of the fold. He misses it, some days—the hard work, the adrenaline, the camaraderie. But he doesn’t linger on the things he’s lost, not when the pieces he does have need so much work. Lena has been after him to try an old world remedy called therapy, which, from what Val can gather, involves a lot of talking and a lot of patience. Well, at least he’s good at one of those.

“This is amazing.” Rowan’s quiet voice breaks through Val’s reverie.

He looks up to see Rowan smiling—no longer a rare sight, but still just as valuable. Valerian smiles back and eats another spoonful. “It’s called ukha. I’m glad you like it. Took me years to get the recipe right, and it was never as good as Roman’s.” His smile fades. “I suppose I’m still missing something.”

Rowan considers for a moment. He takes a slow, exploratory sip. “...Huh. Have you tried a splash of—what’s the stuff called, from Lena—”

“Vodka?” A tiny thrill runs through Val’s stomach as he considers. “Hold on.”

He returns with a half-full bottle. A dash for his bowl, and one for Rowan’s. Val finds himself oddly nervous as he stirs the broth and raises a spoonful to his lips.

The vodka does complement well. It’s exactly what Val’s recipe was lacking—yet it still tastes nothing like Roman’s.

“I think it’s perfect,” Rowan declares. “Seriously, Val, you should write this down.”

Val eats another spoonful, savoring and analyzing. It is perfect. Distinct from Roman’s, but just as good.

Rowan brushes his long hair from his face and happily polishes off his bowl. Val watches him eat with an old, complicated twist in his heart. There will always be a part of him that longs for answers he’ll never receive. But he does know three things.

I loved him. I killed him. I saved him.

His dreams are quiet tonight.`

    description:`Maybe I’m trying to see shape, structure, where there is none. Good morning. Glass of ginger tea. Paper tag mangled: a little origami nothing. Now let’s unscrunch last Thursday. Wow, has it been a week already?

I didn’t see him, not at first, even though he was right in front of me, approaching. I scanned the tables outside, unfamiliar faces, and made to go inside – and that’s when I saw him. Quite small, very thin, dressed in dull blues and greys, a windbreaker. He’d almost camouflaged into the pavement, the drab greens and browns of the street trees, the grey of the evening sky. He took up so little space that I genuinely hadn’t seen him.

I kissed both his cheeks – very almost kissed him on the lips, internally scolded myself. Don’t know why it happened. A little unhinged? A sense of familiarity?

But I’d already decided I wasn’t attracted to him. Often the case with online dating. We took a seat outside, laying our things—phones, wallet, cigarettes—around a wet lump of bird shit on the table which he (attractively, in hindsight) didn’t fuss over. Laid his smoked cigarettes right beside it, actually. Hand-rolled, no filters, brown, sad and soggy, twisted at the end like those tiny explosives that kids toss at the pavement – pop!

Three cigarettes and two pints later, I was seeing him differently, fascinated by the shift in perspective. My internal dialogue observed the transformation as he spoke about code as a language, as something beautiful. At this proximity, he came into focus like the Snellen chart and I could point out all his tumbling E’s. We struggle to see the fine details at a distance, I suppose – visually, emotionally.

And as he spoke about authors I’ve never read, a bunch of someone-vsky’s, his mind started to take up all the space his body didn’t, and by the end of the night he was quite tall. Long and lanky, smoking a cigarette by the terrace. Half inside, half out.

He’d just convinced me not to leave after telling me I looked like Keira Knightley (I don’t) and a girl he’d had a crush on growing up. And, by the way, the girl we ran into downstairs was quite pretty, wasn’t she? It was mean, he’d confessed, and he’d said it defensively to create distance. Interesting confession. Honest. So, I’d taken off my shoes again and dived right back under the covers. Clean sheets. A book on the nightstand. Happy again, hands flapping, foot thumping against the mattress like a dog’s tail.

“You’re crazy,” he said, “but cute.” Thick, black-brown eyebrows. A toke of his cigarette.

And he was right – I am kind of crazy, but the acknowledgement of it felt liberating. I felt seen, accepted. Sure, it’s reasonable to be upset about blowing somebody and having them, a moment later, say the neighbour’s pretty. I mean, it’s basic self-respect. Staring up at the ceiling and crying, however, was not the appropriate response. Leaving would have been, but I didn’t mind the apology, the holding of my hand, the transparency. It was kind of like yes, you’re a crying lunatic and I’m rude, but please stay. Unless you want to go, of course, but I’d rather you not. Come on, he’d said, we spent 12 amazing hours together. Sweet, his voice. Delicate.

Unhealthy behaviour, right? I’m leaving. Don’t. I’m leaving. Don’t. Toxic, even. Maladaptive. Defensive. Refreshing, though, to be accepted.

And his bedroom felt like home, whatever that is. I felt welcome. Haven’t felt like that since I was a teenager. My then-boyfriend and I’d spend entire weekends in his bedroom, eating cheese on toast and playing Guitar Hero, but that’s a whole other can of worms.

Anyway, I was overly affectionate as though I already knew him, and no, I won’t blame it on the oxytocin or the dopamine rush of novelty. OK, maybe the latter played a role, but only because I was excited to feel something for somebody, to appreciate both their mind and body. And he was quite pretty, really. Prettier than I am. In an odd way. In a clumsily elegant kind of way as though he’d fallen into elegance or stumbled onto it as though onto a stage. I can still see him hunched over a mug of cereal, standing by a moka pot on the stove top. It’s strange the mental images we store of others, of trivial but tender moments. Banal. I’m an octopus collecting souvenirs like shells and stones, a suit of armour, camouflage. Do I fit in now? Moments of normalcy, of affection, of belonging. I didn’t mean to wrap my tentacles around you. Suffocating, I’ve been called. By a psychologist (I’d call her a bitch but it’d make you question my sanity).

Anyway, I felt alive again. Hopeful. It wasn’t limerence nor lust, just an appreciation of someone’s mind. Comfort. It’s not often that I get to live in the present. Never want to. Underwhelming. Disenchanting. Still, I won’t fill the void with just anybody. I won’t fill this space with an arbitrary yes. I need to save it, keep it open for somebody who fits. This connection, however, was one I was willing to pursue. Unrequited, though. How is a connection unrequited? His smile reached his eyes. Caught him looking at me as I did my hair. He laughed, truly, when I kissed him or burrowed my nose in his armpit – don’t ask. He felt like cup noodles in winter, pizza and pyjamas in bed, pages beneath a bedside lamp, a Bible in the drawer of a nightstand. And it was nice to actually meet someone beneath the surface, to imbue the external with new connotations determined by their depths. A pleasant reminder that people are beautiful just as they are, beyond beauty standards and gender roles. To rediscover that beauty again was an Indian burn, painful but lovely – it stung but the aching naïveté can’t help but make me smile still.

Such an interesting person. Such interesting features: a dance of strength and delicacy. An aquiline nose, imperial. Graceful, he was, hip bones protruding as he stretched, T-shirt revealing a shy snail trail over his mocha skin, belly button yawning. His torso so long, so pretty. Effeminate, the kind I’d usually shy away from as though they were embarrassing to be seen with. I suppose genuinely liking somebody removes the shame, though, and inspires us to just be. I was comfortable with my body, with my hair. Didn’t think twice. He just was, and now I think we belong to an earlier generation, to the days of yellow crooked teeth, of bare skin and vulgar accessories. Can’t we all just be grotesquely pretty or charmingly ugly, like a young Kate Moss or just like him: an alien beauty in a T-shirt tucking his hair behind his ear. He’d just given me his hair tie as I’d forgotten mine.

I could have spent days in his bed, if I’m being honest. Could have had a tea party on his bedroom floor, played dress-up. There’s a juvenile faith to all these rituals, a verdant exuberance for life. But sometimes I misattribute this magic, my magic, to others. Though the present is often disenchanting, as I’ve mentioned, I can be very good at being present. When I am, people question the authenticity of it. Fickle, they think, for feeling so intensely. Though the moment’s all there is, really. And when you’ve got a good one (or a handful), you seize it. I wonder how much of it was my magic and how much of it was his.

Sometimes, I think I’m a wind instrument, hollow, and something sings through me. I’m a doorframe, empty, a portal into another world. People see it, and I know they do. But they also fear it. Question it. He saw it, felt it. Smile reaching his eyes. Tender brushing of my arm. Contemplating me. But when the moment’s over, reality resumes. I’m sorry I made you feel something, I’d like to say, and I’m sorry that scared you. Open relationship, he’s in. It slipped out in an anecdote. Swept under the rug like a pin, popcorn in couch cushions. Other emotional commitments, he has. Indecisive. Overwhelmed in his own words. Sweet. Well-intentioned. Confused.

Sometimes, I wish people would just tell me the desmaquillada truth. Hey, I have a girlfriend whom I love and I’m only looking for something casual. Then I could say: OK, well I’m not sure where my life is taking me anyway, but I’d like to be present with you again just like this. How’s Saturday at six? Nobody ever tells me, though. They underestimate my understanding and magnify my madness.

Wasn’t limerence, was it? I said it wasn’t. Maybe it was. But it was nice to rediscover beauty in a windbreaker, a pair of jeans, bulging eyes and bony knees. Like turning over a rock and finding, amongst the grubs, a treasure map.

Second cup. Ginger tea to soothe the (strep!) throat. Blew a stranger the other night out of pity and people pleasing. Almost vomited on the way home out of disgust and self-loathing. I’m a seesaw. My lows launch me into highs, my highs plummet me into lows. I’d just wanted another dopamine rush, just wanted to get drunk. Called in sick the next day. And here it is all on paper, yet another origami nothing. Fold it into a shapeless clump, tousle the edges, hand roll it like a cigarette – brown, sad and soggy. Say there’s meaning where there isn’t any.`

    description:`Jen lived by the unwritten rules of being single but wanting a child. Don’t look at children. Don’t engage with children. Don’t talk about children. Don’t let other people talk about their children. And don’t, for the love of all that is holy, tell anyone you long for a child.


A nearby suitor could be eyeing you up, biting their bottom lip at the sight of your untoned bum, lusting after your wide midriff, admiring your conical legs. They could be subconsciously sliding you through their mental mold of their dream woman, seeing you slot in just right. Only to see your face change from that of a promising conquest to a maniacal ovary, ready to snatch the sperm of the nearest purveyor to fulfill your vapid, barren life.

Looking at, engaging with, talking about, or listening to stories about children will, to even the most gullible testicles-owner, immediately announce your desperate, ugly yearning like a tannoy in a tin.


So it was a treat for Jen to allow herself to sit in front of a beautiful, cherubic baby and gaze in unfettered awe and longing. She had been doing this almost every week lately. The museum, a former church, was on her walk home on Fridays, when she worked only half a day. The exhibition had been on display since January, but it was early Spring when she found herself sputtering around, trying to look interesting to a society obsessed only with the happenings of her womb. Trying to look like she was, indeed, living her best life, flitting from exhibition to dinner date, eating the world around, unburdened by responsibility.


The first day she went to the exhibition, she found Her. A mother, THE mother. A miracle hewn from marble, nursing Her baby beatifically. Stone had given birth, yet she was not. And this statue was a virgin for god’s sake. She loved Her instantly, though on her first few visits, she hastened past Her, fearful that those watching would delight in the poetic tragedy of the sight; a childless woman gazing up at the immaculate mother of mothers.


Jen’s childlessness oozed out of her. It soaked her sheets and rattled her guts. It was a repugnance only she seemed to acknowledge. But she noticed it so solidly for the last two years, she had thought of little else. She tried to hide her childlessness from onlookers, mask it from bystanders, but it was in vain. She knew that all who saw her, saw a woman, not a mother. All who saw her, with their modern views and progressive thoughts, forgave her on sight, of course. But the flash of forgiveness was mortifying. She felt it from everyone she encountered.


Everyone but him. He was wiry and sort of ugly and smelled of the kind of sports deodorant that reminds everyone of sweat. He looked at the statue, looked at Jen, then back at the statue and screwed his face quizzically.


“Is she bumming you out?” he asked with a raspy voice that sounded like an old lady who claims that smoking is what’s keeping her alive. "Excuse me?" Jen replied after checking her empty peripherals. "Why are you looking at her if she’s making you sad?" he asked, with a sense of informality she wasn’t used to. "Do I know you?" she asked. "Do we just keep asking each other questions?" he replied, thinking himself very clever. "I’m sorry, can I help you?" she replied, kicking herself for continuing the game she had no interest in playing. He narrowed his eyes and she saw a vague handsomeness somewhere around his jawline. "I’ll leave you alone. You looked sad but I didn’t think you really were sad so I was making a joke. But…sorry, I’ll leave you to it", he said without a single muscle of his body living up to this promise. "I’m not sad. It’s art. It’s supposed to make you sad", she said, far too defensively.


She felt rumbled. He was a hick. He didn’t have the sophistication to forgive her on sight like the others. It reminded her of the time when she, a serious teenager, was asked by a child why her face was all dots. And how the adults comforted the uninjured child but not her.

“Is it?” he asked with what seemed like genuine curiosity. "It’s art", she repeated knowingly, the upper hand. "I always find the stone ones so creepy. It’s because they don’t have eyelashes. They should use cat hair or something. Or fake eyelashes", he meandered, seemingly unaware that Jen was winning. "You’ve lovely eyelashes" Jen said and brought her purse to her mouth hoping to vomit the words into it instead of the ether. "Oh, sorry. I mean people have lovely eyelashes. Not you. You too. But, you know, everyone". He smiled and she fell in love with him momentarily the way she fell in love with everyone with a vas deferens momentarily these days. "They’re fake," he said, smiling proudly at his stupid joke. "So, why does this make you sad?" 


She thought for a moment. Thought about wanting to be a statue, to be frozen, voiceless, heartless. Childless, but nursing another statue. She hated him. She felt naked, she wanted to run but was gripping to the galloping high horse she hoped he was aware of. She was going to make him run. She had a super power for repelling. "Because I want a baby, and she has one" she said, more quietly and tenderly than she had planned. "Ah", he replied flatly. 


She waited for him to shuffle his feet, to check his watch, to answer his phone. She could sense him planning his apologetic escape. She felt him admonish himself for his uncouth lack of awareness, for missing the sillage of her childlessness. He seemed to be gathering himself. The years of manners beaten into him flooding to the front of mind, seeking ground after this calamitous misstep. How to politely, stoically, apologetically extricate himself from this hideous interaction. 


"Well, if you think that baby’s great, wait until you see the size of the horse some soldier guy has in the next room. Come on, I’ll show you", he replied, his smile softer but warmer. She stood up and they went to look at a marble horse

    description:`From: Emily —----------------

To:   Mac —--------------

Date: December 31, 1998

Subject:     “Hello, Goodbye.”



Dear Mac:


“Hello!”


Em’ here – just writing to let you know: “I’m out” - “We’re done.” -“That’s it.” 


I’ve been thinking about it for a very long time and I just can’t go through with the whole thing. You know what I mean, right? It’s over! We’re through. That’s all.


I don’t want you standing at the altar either. That would not be fun. Just standing there.  


Like some kind of a statue. Staring at the bouquets and bouquets of flowers we’ll probably get from all our wonderful friends and family members. Searching back and forth to the door. Watching for me. Waiting for me. I can imagine that that might not be such a great time.  


So I’m glad I got this note to you – ahead of that whole crazed event!


Just so you know, FYI, like, I did call and leave a rather lengthy message in the general voicemail box at your work. It was really quite long. Probably like this email will be. I hope the other diesel mechanics don’t tease you about it.


But truthfully, I’ve given it some real deep thought, and fact of the matter is, I’ve been sleep walking through this entire relationship. Not thinking about me for one second.  


I mean I wasn’t thinking of our future when we were dating. I just kept bumpin’ along, goin’ along until the next dinner out, I guess. I think that’s probably not what you wanted to hear. They were good dinners though.


You were so kind with your hard-earned money. Taking me out to special social engagements. Jazz on Wednesday nights at the Blues Notes Cafe for example.  


Of course, who could forget the wonderful flowers at every holiday. Even on Halloween. Silly willy!


And those snow bird trips to Florida every year – a godsend reprieve in the waning months of a tortuous New England winter.  


And my car. All those free grease and oil changes. And the monthly maintenance you did for me. Really, really sweet of you.


Plus all that other stuff you did on the rig that you really can’t afford. In fact, the truck is still so beautiful. Hardly a scratch or nick. Rock solid. Ever since you swapped out the timing belt and had the water pump replaced, put new tires on, did an overhaul of the gas and brake lines, completely reupholstered the inside so that there’s not one hole that the eye can see – those were the details that made the difference.


It’s been running so well. 


Thank you again.


I just hope that this note gets to you. In time. And I don’t forget to press the Send button. Like I do for all the most important messages in my life. They always end up in an electronic mail purgatory kind of hell – also known as ‘Drafts.’ I don’t know why they call it that; ‘Drafts.’ Not all of the messages I send are ‘cold.’  


In fact, most of ‘em were pretty ‘hot!’ And I’m keeping those private photos from you that you made for me in a special folder. And no, I could never extort you. For anything. I don’t think. I’m pretty sure I’m not that kind of girl.


But pressing the ‘Send’ button always seems like some crazy hurdle. I don’t know why. It’s just a button, you know?


Pressing ‘submit,’ or pressing ‘back,’ those buttons are never a problem. Just ‘send’ it seems.


Anyway.


We always, ALWAYS had fun together. What with our love of practical jokes. I could do just about anything to you and you would be receptive.  


Oh, that paint can full of shaving cream that I had fall on your head when you came round the corner into the living room on your fortieth birthday – just hilarious! You wiping up soap bubbles for days. That turned into weeks. I didn’t know they could last that long!


I’m sure you’ll understand all this. You always did.  


You’re always so nice and kind. I really liked that about you.


In fact, I can’t tell you how many times my parents looked forward to you coming over to their house. Just to say, “Hello.”


Or help them out with chores around the house. Like the back breaking work my Dad always lined up for you. Wood that needed splitting and stacking. Lawns that needed mowing. You were so much like their own personal indentured servant. My Dad really liked that about you.


Taking out the bags and bags and bags of nasty trash after we cleaned the basement out that one time. After the floods. Oh, and the garage too! So much gross stuff in so many places. But you were there to throw it all away.


I really loved telling my parents about you and how you treat me each week. So much like a Queen, really. Royalty.   


I mean I never had someone at my beckon call either – at the jingle of a hand bell. Until I met you.  


My previous husbands, those three lugnuts, just couldn’t handle me. But you could. That’s something I’m really, really going to miss. I don’t know where I’ll find an object of my love that will do and buy for me everything I could ever want in the near future.


Always so kind.


When my mental issues went back and forth. Left and right, up and down. My not being diagnosed for all that time sure must have got tiring. Making the time we spend together even more difficult. Like ‘doing time’ really.


And I never could find it in me to say, “I’m sorry,” either.  


I still can’t. Those words are not part of my vocabulary. And they never will leave my mouth. It’s bad enough I’ve typed them onto this piece of paper.  


I can’t admit guilt for anything.


Like taking you down several notches with scathing verbal jabs out in public.  


Personally, I’d rather have a long drawn out battle in court. I mean, I am keeping everything. Including the ring. I more than deserve it. I know I do.


If times get tough, I can always hock it for a couple bucks. Or some really strong bourbon.  


All of it though, always, always better than lifting any finger and doing work for ‘the man.’ Which I vowed that I never would do. That’s why I had you, right? Mondays were for sleeping in. Tuesdays too!


Well that’s all I can bare to type. There’s really nothing else left to say.  


Plus, I hardly ever write over 200 words.




“Goodbye,” my love,


– Emmy.

    description:`On my last shift as a lighthouse keeper, I climbed the seventy-six spiral iron stairs and two ladders to the watch room, the number of steps the same as my age. The thwomp and snare of each step laid an ominous background score. Something wasn’t right. At that very moment, Richie Tedesco was pointing a fire extinguisher at the burning electrical panel in the engine room of his boat a few miles offshore.


The placard in the watch room read “Marge Mabrity, Lightkeeper—First lighted the depths on March 2nd, 1985, and hasn’t missed a night.” Already so close to forty years. I could still read the skies like a book. The lighthouse smelled of aging wood, dried-out moss, and the bitter acid spritz of corrosion. But out on the gallery deck, leaning against the handrails, there was the unmistakable scent of petrichor. The clouds in the distance grew taller, black shading growing across their swelling bellies, with the storm caps flattening under the weight of the system. I tasted the metallic hint of ozone on my tongue. I felt the intensity of the pressure in my ears and on my forehead.


I know what you are thinking. Why had I even done it? For all those years. I guess finding lost things was always the one thing about me that was uniquely my own. And I didn’t know if I could give it up.


A few miles back toward the mainland, Cappie patrolled the Long Island ports and seaways on his tug, waiting for salvage and rescue calls. There were still enough of them to get by. Especially with these yahoos taking up boating. But the seas were not what they used to be, and Cappie barely eked out a life of sustenance back on land. Lone rangers like us were going extinct in this world of ubiquitous connection and universal alienation. It was a world of gadgets now. But it turned out our kind was more needed than ever when the gadgets failed.


The three of us, in our solitary orbits, were bound on an intersecting course.


How many things had I retired from in a lifetime of retirements? However many it was, this one felt different. A transplant from Norway, full of Viking blood, I’d had a brief career on the national downhill skiing circuit. I’d hung that up for university. Then I’d hung up the mantle of a student for a job in forestry. Quit that to start a family. That transient period that seemed never-ending before the kids left home turned out not to be. My marriage ended too. And on and on. But the longest stint was my forty years as the Lighthouse Keeper at Montauk Point.


It was to be a ceremonial night.


Still, it felt wrong.


Even if I was pushing eighty. Who was I to buy into this twaddle about graceful exits and diminished capacity?


My thoughts were disturbed by a call on the radio.


Channel 19.


It was Cappie.


I didn’t want a mayday call.


Not tonight.


* * *


Richie Tedesco was lost at sea.


As lost as lost can be.


The fire in the engine room had only taken minutes to put out, but the electrical lines were irreparably damaged. Hours later, when the last of the juice in the ship’s backup batteries ran out, Richie watched as the monitors with the electronic ocean maps and satellite-supported GPS positioning flickered and went black.


Richie might as well have been surveying the moon. He had no idea of his location. It’s odd how easily we take for granted that we know where we are, never realizing how often we are hopelessly lost and don’t even know it.


Night navigation is a real son-of-a-bitch. A swabbie mug untrained in navigation would be facing long odds of surviving such a calamity. And on the spectrum of swabbie mugs, Richie wasn’t even at the top of the class. But how did Richie get here?


A few months back, Richie had bought a custom Sea Ray Sundancer 370 when he was promoted. Of course, he couldn’t afford the new model. He settled for a year-old model with the same look and feel, but which had been heavily used and abused by the prior owner, who was a real boater. But no bother. It was his prized possession.


Richie hadn't accounted for the cost of marina dues and other ancillary costs. With the hefty loan he’d taken on the boat, he lacked the funds for all the accouterments of the boating life, things both expensive and confusing for the uninitiated seaman. These turned out to be necessary.


Richie had skimped on maintenance and hired an inexperienced handyman named Louie (who was known around the marina as ‘Louie the Wrench’) to help with keeping the vessel seaworthy. A gamble that failed. Louie spent a lot more time on the phone with his bookie than with his wrench in hand.


The sun lounge and dining area in the hollowed-out front hull was what first had sold him. Richie had imagined spending long romantic weekends, with Rene, from the spring to the fall, jaunting from marina to marina, exploring the New England coast. Enjoying white wine or a martini together in the sun lounge at sundown, over a decadent charcuterie board, and raw seafood on ice.


By Richie’s calculations, this routine would somehow make up for his soulless existence earning obscene—but still inadequate-to-the-expected-lifestyle wages—spending all his daylight hours keeping his employer out of hot water by enforcing labyrinthine government regulations, effective only in the great lengths his employer was willing to go through and the great costs his employer was willing to expend to completely avoid the salutary, remedial purposes the regulations stood for in the first place.


Rene didn’t care about the predatory nature of the enterprise or how monotonous and unsexy the work was, but the fact that Richie was not the top dog. Not by a long shot. And there was little hope of improvement there. Five years for a promotion of title with a raise in bonus but not base pay? Rene knew what that meant long before Richie did.


Rene was not an adventurer. She was a social climber. Replacement Richie had a proper yacht, a newer model Mercedes, and a pricier high-rise condominium. He ran his own company doing something that sounded borderline illegal, and let’s be honest, probably was. He cheated on his taxes. Replacement Richie wasn’t apologizing for it either—it was a kick. He took what he wanted.


Rene spent the weekends with Replacement Richie and her exchangeable NPC girlfriends sunbathing on the deck of Replacement Richie’s yacht, surrounded by a display of designer bags and branded bathing suit pullovers and slides. The yacht stayed permanently moored at the Star Island Yacht Club & Marina (more prestigious than Richie’s Jersey City marina). The yacht was used exclusively for marina clout and cocktail convos. It never once saw the open seas all spring and summer. But everyone had a fabulous time of it and didn’t seem bothered at all.


Rene’s Instagram post of her engagement ring, anchoring her fates to Replacement Richie had done it. NPC girlfriend Vic was sure to comment first, for everyone’s knowledge, that it was, in fact, a 4.05-carat round diamond with a perfect “colorless” grade. The NPC’s knew on sight, like puppies who can sense one of their litter about to be adopted. It took Richie longer to find out. It was a $250K ring.


In one moment, Richie knew for certain that this romance would have no second act. He did the only thing that made sense at the time. He took to the open seas. Alone. Without telling anyone.


Richie sat out in the sun lounge alone in the darkness trying to gain enough night vision to make out a landmark in the fog of dark. Richie had made all the rookie boating mistakes. The first rule of boat safety is not to go out alone. Chart a course. Tell a friend. Most people who get lost at sea stay lost. That is true on land as well. Despite getting his boating license, Richie skipped on-water training. The list went on and on.


Perhaps worst of all, Richie couldn’t tell land-based lights from navigation lights from buoys and markers. He’d spent the last two hours heading further out to sea and nearly scraping the side of a three-meter-tall red ocean buoy that towered over the deck of his humble cruiser.


And that was when he panicked and started firing off his flares.


* * *


“How is my best girl tonight?” Cappie asked.


“Don’t be fresh with me. You old rake. You mean, with it being my last night?”


“Ahh, fiddlesticks. Last night my arse. We both know you are gonna be buried on that rock, and me with you.”


“As romantic as that is, I like a nice dinner and some wine before committing to a joint burial.”


“Well, well. You little siren. Whetting my appetite. Marge, you’re gonna love this one.”


“What is it Cappie?”


“I’ve been tuned in on Channel 19 for the last fucking hour.” Cappie chuckled. His voice rattled. A deep raspy bass that hit like a fine brass-colored Scotch. It intoxicated my senses and warmed my chest off the first sip. It sang a lifetime of hard songs, but the calloused old heart was in there. He was old salt. Everything you imagined a seaman to be. Gray beard, sun-scorched skin, and a temperament mercurial enough to match the open seas. In his mid-seventies, Cappie was still fit and lean. But a little tired of a lifetime of wandering.


“Sounds delightful,” I said. “Did they locate your chivalry and manners? Or have those gone the way of Davy Jones too?”


“Get this. Some clueless yo-pro has been singing an off-key Rhianna playlist—Ree-ann-eh—all the way through, non-stop, not realizing his radio line is open. Must have pushed the microphone button into something. The radio went dark after sundown.”


“God help us.”


“You see that black squall coming in from the west? Well, this yo-pro, let’s call him Chadwick. Well, Chadwick here, he has been headed east out into the open seas, and he’s going to get clipped by that sail shredder on his way back to port, if he even knows enough to head back to port. Coast Guard has been trying to reach him, with no response.”


I could hear it in his voice. Cappie’s full name was Jack “Tommy” Rogers. And Cappie was always into a bottle of his namesake. Cappie only had a few rules, and one was that he never touched the bottle until he’d finished his calls. Someone could lose their life if he broke that rule like he’d done tonight. Something serious was going on with Cappie.


“How are the seas tonight,” I asked.


“Seas are building. Cthulhu is growing restless. We are just chugging along on the gasoline breeze out here waiting for our damsel in distress to call for a knight in shining armor on his noble stallion or in this case a hundred-year-old tugger.”


“Oh, Cappie! I didn’t know it was your hundredth birthday today. Happy birthday!”


“Touché,” he said.


Cthulhu is what he called his tugboat. I asked once. I regretted it. To this day. Something about how his straight lines were like the tentacles of some weird Octopus god.


“She’s all buttoned up, tight as a button, and I’m getting a bit high off the diesel fumes.” It was more than the diesel that Cappie was high on.


I imagined Cappie out there. Be careful to avoid the reef, old man. I can see him threading through frigates, tankers, cutters, and cruise ships (like floating cities). I worry about Cappie.


And that night, I wanted to tell him how I felt. But I tried to restrain myself.


It was a big night. No sense in complicating it.


“I was afraid this was going to be a mayday call,” I said.


Then it occurred to me, that maybe it was one.


* * *


It was a moonless night. Richie couldn’t tell the sea from the sky. It was so dark that all that was visible was the wake of the ship drawing a white foam trail through the otherwise black void. There is that verse in Revelations where the heavens and earth pass away and there is no longer any sea. Richie didn’t believe in that kind of thing. But it had happened. All that was left was infinite negative space.


Richie’s skin crawled, and his forehead dampened. The night was muggy, and an invisible cooling mist enveloped the cruiser. The only sounds were lapping waves, and the only smell was a briny whiff of sea foam.


How lost are you when you have lost your bearings and don’t know the distance to any safe harbor? Richie had not considered this before. The darkness is impartial. Absolute. Unforgiving. But in its grip, you felt that its horrors were custom-tailored, handcrafted, and made-to-measure. Just for you. Richie sure felt that way.


There was that foreboding, ominous sense. That the evils at play, which seemed resolved to engineer your demise, are the earned wages for some sin, the gravity of which you failed to appreciate. Whose wrath was stirred by your trespasses? God? Nature? Some malignant spirit of vengeance? What evil deed tipped the scales to a sentence of death? These were Richie’s thoughts.


The gas gauge became an instrument of terror.


Richie cursed his reckless disregard. Why didn’t he pack extra canned goods and five more reserve five-liter fuel cans?


How could he have been so arrogant?


So foolish?


And then, the rains started to fall, like icy darts from the heavens.


* * *


“Marge to Cappie. Where are you?”


“Headed out to sea.”


“What?”


“Chadwick isn’t going to save himself.”


“Cappie! You old fool. It isn’t safe.”


“Don’t get sentimental on me now, you old cow. I’ve got a job to do.”


“Stay safe out there, will you.”


Cappie barked like a dog. “Roof roof.”


And that’s all I needed to hear.


* * *


No one was coming to save him. That was Richie’s last thought before firing off his last flare.


He pulled out a pack of Marlboro Reds and lit one up.


Richie smoked on the sun lounge and thought about his life, which might be coming to an end.


He judged his life poorly. He hadn’t lived it. He’d bought the marketing in the pamphlet but hadn’t pursued the dream the pamphlet was selling. And now it was too late.


For the first time in years, Richie felt reinvigorated. Clear. Awakened. Alive.


* * *


Cappie’s tugger was at full tilt, boat-jumping the waves. The gales of the squall buffeted the front visor and tossed the ship among the crests, pushing it off course, making it hard to keep a broad breach and hit the waves at a clean 45° to avoid the worst of the punch of the storm.


Cappie located Richie’s cruiser. And then reached it. He took out a bullhorn and tried to tell Richie he was there, but the winds were like a dark room for sound. And Richie had no idea Cappie was out there.


Cappie pulled up and started setting the straight wires, attaching them to the stern of Richie’s cruiser. After a while, Richie came out and realized what was happening. He stood there holding tight to the table in the galley as the cruiser bobbed in the wake. After the winch brought the ships together, Cappie came aboard.


“What you doing out here son?”


“Long story. Can you get me back to shore?”


“Can I? Will do is more like it. First, let’s check the vessel.”


While Cappie was on the galley, inspecting the cruiser, a sadistic gust rocked the boat and Cappie tumbled over the safety pole. Richie looked down and saw he had grabbed the ropes along the trim and molding and was rocking with the boat, his legs gusting in the winds.


“Get the line from the capstan on my boat, get it to me.”


“The what?”


“The circular thing with the ropes.”


In seconds, Richie was back with the rope. Cappie clutched it and climbed back aboard. He slumped on the deck, breathing heavily.


“Not bad son. You’ve graduated from Greenhorn to Seaman tonight. Congratulations. Now let’s get you back to shore.”


* * *


“Cthulhu inbound,” Cappie called back to me.


“Thank God,” I said.


“Chadwick’s name is Richie. Works in finance. Heartbroken Greenhorn. Can’t make this up.”


“Do you see the beacon?”


“Like I need a beacon to get me back to you.”


“You old salty dog.”


“The kid told me he’s leaving finance. Might move to Montauk. Said the sea is calling.”


“God help us.”


“So, are you following through on this thing?”


“I’m an old woman, Jack.”


“We could do it together.”


“Give me a break.”


“I’ll spend nights up there with you. Patrol days.”


“Don’t tease me.”


“I’m serious Marge. I’ll be back in half an hour. Once the emergency folks take Chadwick here to the hospital, I say we have that dinner and those drinks.”


“We’ve known each other thirty years.”


“You want to wait for forty?”


“I just…”


“Just nothing Marge. I almost died tonight.”


“What?”


“But my last thought was that I almost let you fucking retire.”


“You almost died?”


“I’ll be back in a half hour and I’m coming up there, invited or not, so get yourself ready. And you are not retiring. That’s also not negotiable, Marge. Not up for discussion.”


“Where has this Cappie been all my life?”


“Lost at sea, I guess. But I’m coming ashore.”


I’m a modest woman, so I won’t tell you how it all turned out. But let’s just say, it’s hard to refuse an old salty dog that won’t take no for an answer.

    description:`Nobody at NASA gave a goddamn about the weather in Jersey. This fact, as true and as simple as it was, had not stopped my Aunt Rosie from pacing around the parlor all morning and pressing her face to the front window in search of thunderstorms. My mother had yelled at her for smearing rouge on the glass, and she, of course, had yelled right back. And soon, everybody was yelling. 


It was the day of my brother Eddie’s wedding, the day of the moon landing, and rain meant a lot of things. It meant a shower of good fortune, pouring out from God Himself, Amen, onto the newlyweds, but it also meant the destruction of our poor astronauts (one of whom was a good Jersey boy)—spacemen, who were already so far outside our atmosphere that nothing happening here could do anything to them. It didn’t matter, though, not to Rosie. They would be struck by lightning, and they would plummet into the Atlantic, and they would die, and we’d lose the race. 


But it didn’t rain. It was goddamn muggy, though, muggy enough to cause the streamers tied to the back of Eddie and Marie’s limousine to half-melt and make colors streak down the white, but it didn’t rain. 


I stepped out the reception into the parking lot that evening to light up a cigarette, a loner from the pocket of my too-tight tuxedo. The restaurant itself was empty by now; I could see the tables through the windows. Marie’s father had only rented the backroom because he was a cheap-ass. But even though the party was starting to fade, cousins and friends rushing home to watch whatever was going to happen happen, I could still hear the stragglers through the closed door. 


Striking up a match from the book I’d snagged from the front counter, I watched the smoke furl upward toward the moon. They were up there right now. That was goddamn insane. They were up there, and I was standing here, looking up at them. And maybe some part of me really could reach them like this, I thought. Maybe they would see my cigarette smoke, and they would know I was here. So few people really did.


“You all better hurry. You gotta get there before Marie does,” Rosie yammered, rushing out my parents’ front door after my uncle, who was waving his arms at her. “I know, Ron. I know. Start the goddamn car, would you? Listen, Eddie, if you see her in the dress, it’s bad luck. Bad, bad luck. Curse on your house. You’ll never have children, and it’ll break my heart. Get to the church, get inside, and God help you, don’t look out any windows.” 


And so we did. That afternoon, me and Eddie and the three other groomsmen, only one of whom was good-looking, squeezed into the back of a Lincoln Continental. They had shoved past me shouting for the radio. And climbing in last, I watched from my place in the rear as the four of them leaned over the front like gargoyles. 


The chauffeur, which I guess is what you call a person in this line of work, was actually wearing one of those little caps you see on television. He already had the broadcast running, and we sat there on the curb together and listened.


“We’re gonna be late! They’re gonna yell at us, Eddie.” But no one paid me any mind because, just like that, it was really happening. The radio counted down the descent, and when the Eagle finally landed (and nothing exploded), the car, even the driver, erupted into cheers. With that, as if noticing the time, the vehicle revved and swerved as it took off, nearly hitting the sidewalk and taking out a lamppost. I gripped the door handle.


The streets in which I had grown up, the school, the druggist, passed by in a technicolor blur of familiar sights and sounds. Everything was exactly the same as it had always been, but just like that, it was different too. The world was different, so this would be a moment, I realized. From here on out, there would be everything before it and everything after it. 


We had to take a detour to loop around because a road was closed, and Marie and her bridesmaids had arrived in the time it took. I watched Saint John’s rising in the distance. A woman in a pink dress, someone’s sister, was trying to flag us down as we rolled up, and I learned later that she had to lock Marie behind a door in the basement where nobody could get a good look at her, on account of curses and all. 


I took a long inhale of my cigarette, allowing my eyes to flutter closed, when I heard the metal door to the hall slam open—followed by the crunching stride of shoes on the pavement. It was not my brother sneaking off to start his honeymoon early, or one of his drunk buddies, or even my father, trying to get away from Aunt Rosie. 


No, it was a waiter, a tall guy in a greenish vest, his brow glistening with sweat from the kitchen. He was freckled, I remember thinking. They crept up his neck, onto his cheeks, and along his forearms, revealed by his rolled-up sleeves, like burning wildflowers, ruddy clouds dotting his skin like poppies. He nearly crashed into me in what may have been anger or frustration, a temperament as red as he was.


“Oh! I’m so sorry, sir. I wasn’t watching.” He muttered hurriedly, running a hand through his orange hair and offering something of an apologetic, gap-toothed smile. 


“You’re fine, pal. No harm done. You good?” 


“Yeah, yeah. Cigarette break. You got a light?” 


I nodded, handing over the book of matches as he pulled a carton of Luckies from his back pocket. He lit one up and gave me a nod, blowing his first puff over his shoulder as if to be polite—as if I were not an expert in the same goddamn bad habit he was.


“Thanks a million. You’re allowed to smoke inside, ya know. Guests are. Not me. I gotta come out here,” he explained.


“Oh, uh, my mom don’t know I do it,” I replied with something of a weak laugh, shrugging my shoulders. I spoke up again only to fill the abrupt silence. “And she also don’t know that I know that she does too. Out the bathroom window, ya know? To be sneaky?”


He laughed the way a movie star laughes, full-bodied and hearty, golden, before blowing out another cloud of smoke. It mingled with mine, and together, it whirled upward toward Aldrin and Armstrong. “It, uh, looks like a nice wedding,” he said. “You with the bride or groom?”


“The groom’s my brother,” I replied. Deciding I really should be less of a brute, then, I stuck out a hand to shake. “Dominic Moretti. People call me Dom.”


“People call me Barty.” He watched me smoke for a moment before flashing a grin, cigarette nestling securely into the space between his teeth. “I bet you they’re missing you in there, Dom. Saw you really cuttin’ a rug earlier.”


“No one even knows I’m gone.” But I knew what he had meant. The band had struck up an old favorite, and I, swaying to the music, found my arms wrapped around the pink chiffon-ed back of bridesmaid Nan Chabowski, twenty-six, pretty, and bored.


For the moment, she did not sway with me, regarding me the way a person regards socks on Christmas. They’re fine, of course, but not what you wanted. Still, I had been paired with her during the wedding, and I guess we were supposed to dance together. Everyone else was. She draped her wrists over my shoulders, not really touching me, but making it look like she was. She kept peering around the room. 


“They landed on the moon safe, you know. We heard on the radio,” I said, trying to strike up some kind of conversation. 


“Uh huh,” Nan replied, glancing over her own shoulder, nose wrinkling. “You haven't seen Joey, have ya? I told him I’d save a dance for him back at the church, but Marie paired him with Rita on account of them both being giants. God, I hate being this petite.” She huffed, turning back to meet my eye level, which, of course, meant that I was also petite.


“No. I ain’t seen him.”


“Oh well,” she hummed, turning back around and continuing to scan the room. “Maybe I can make this work. If he sees us having a real swell time, I can…say, how old did you say you were? You’re Eddie’s younger brother, right?


“I’m nineteen. Today, actually. It’s my birthday.”


“Oh. Teenager.” 


Sighing, I tossed my cigarette to the ground and crushed it beneath the toe of my dress shoe. “I don’t really know that girl, you know. She’s just friends with my brother’s wife. I danced with her to be nice,” I replied, leaning back casually and crossing my arms, like in a Western, but looking more crabby than cool


Barty gave another one of those boisterous laughs at that. I studied the way his whole body seemed to shake with the life of it, and I found I was almost jealous of him, of how he laughed. I could not remember ever laughing like that. “Besides, you should be nice to me,” I added quickly, if only to distract myself from Barty’s form. “I’m a customer. I’m always right, ain’t I? And it’s my birthday.” His eyes widened.


“Wait, what? Your brother picked your birthday to get married? Ain’t that a goddamn bite? Now it’ll be his anniversary, and not your birthday. That’s sorta low. If you don’t mind me saying so, but I guess I already said it.”


“I mean, it was the only day the church had. I’m not sour about it. I get it. Weddings are a big deal and all that.”


“Well, happy birthday, Dominic Moretti.” He met my eye, holding my gaze for only a moment before blowing another cloud of smoke over his shoulder.


“Yeah, thanks. Turns out, you’re the only one to tell me that today.”


“No fooling? I’m sorry. Birthdays are rotten things. I turned nineteen in January myself. I think I’ve hated being nineteen. Eighteen was better. But I’ve always really loved being born in January. Feels like standing in a doorway almost. One year’s done, so the next one starts right up with me. I can count them on myself.”


I offered a nod at that before pointing up at the sky to the moon. More than half of it was covered in shadow, so that we could see only the curve of its milk-white edge jutting out among the stars. “Tonight’s a doorway too, you know,” I said. “They’re up there on the moon. Do you think they landed on the shadow part or the light part?” I clicked my tongue, nostrils flaring. “Who cares, I guess. Buzz Aldrin’s from right here in Jersey, you know. But…before tonight, no one has ever been up there. And now they have. We have. It’s insane, ain’t it? I can’t stand it. Everyone’s home waiting to see them walk out, and we’re all stuck here eating goddamn chicken.” I sniffed, flailing my arms a bit to gesture at the restaurant. “Sorry. It was good chicken.”


Barty laughed. “I don’t give a damn about the chicken, Dom. I didn’t cook it. And, yeah, maybe everyone’s sitting at home, and maybe we’re sitting here, but they’re up there, the people who really matter. So how about that, huh? Not one of us is up there. That’s how it goes. Everyone’s always doing somethin’ better, and nobody ever gets to do what they want,” he continued dully, shrugging his shoulders. For a moment, he glanced back to the hall doors, which still sat shut tight. 


“Oh, uh, what do you want to do then? Other than this, I mean? I guess workin’ other people’s wedding’s isn’t really all that good of a time.” I rambled. “Did you always want to work in a restaurant?”


“I wait tables, Dom. I ain’t a chef or even goddamn maître d,” he scoffed, taking another long drag of smoke. It whirled around his lips. “No, you know what I want? I saw in a magazine once, there’s this monster that lives in a lake in Scotland. Back in the 1930s, this surgeon took a picture of it. An actual doctor, so it’s true. Well, I want to go there and find it myself. Bring it back here to Middlesex County. I mean, maybe I ain’t on the moon, nah, but I can still explore everythin’ here, can’t I?” He seemed to surge with this insistence, shoulders rolling, face growing bright and boyish, enough to make a person believe. He glowed, really, with this kind of light I was noticing for the first time ever, one that could put the crowded moon to blushing shame and make me blush too.


“Well, why don’t ya then?”


“Well, why don’t you go in there and tell everyone it’s your birthday, and they’d better not forget it?”


I did not have an answer to this, so slumping a bit, I simply shrugged my shoulders. Barty’s features softened, as if he had realized he had struck some hidden part of me, the scar of maybe where God had torn my rib out. I was the one to speak up again. “You know, sometimes I think my folks had me just in case my brother got hit by a bus. Not that he was ever gonna die for real or nothing, but just to…you know, sort of be a backup. In case,” I laughed, but I knew I was only half-joking. 


“That was smart of ‘em,” Barty replied, giving my shoulder a light shove, an almost over-friendly gesture. I found myself leaning into the contact, chasing some of his glow as if it could reflect back on me. “Havin’ a backup, I mean. I don’t. I don’t know what’s happening tomorrow. The asshole in there? He’s gonna fire me tonight. No, no, don’t tell me he ain’t. He’s not done it yet, but when I walk back in there, he’s gonna. I broke a dish, and he shouted at me, so I told him to kiss my ass for good luck.” He patted his back pocket, where his cigarette carton was sticking out. “Nobody’ll even notice I’m gone neither. Not really. No one ever notices nothing.”


I knew what he meant. I really knew it. But before I could reply, I watched Barty toss his lit cigarette to the ground in a flurry of smoldering ash. Extending both his arms upward, then, stretching himself tall like the neck of that lake monster, he used both his hands to wave, rolling with the full force of himself, the way folks wave at trains and ships.


“I see ‘em, Dom!” He declared, extending one finger to point. His feet left the ground in that moment, and he seemed to jump, giving into this strange, beautiful abandon. “I see ‘em right up there on the surface! And they’re waving right back at me!” A strong hand shot out to grab the sleeve of my jacket, and he tugged me closer, making me spring upward along with him. I bounded, taking a giant leap of my own, a gasp escaping my throat. And looking up at the moon, I thought I could see them up there too, Neil, and Michael, and even Buzz from Jersey. I jumped and jumped, and I laughed. And I waved.


The whole world, the whole goddamn world was looking at them, and so was I. But they were looking at me. They were looking at me, and so was Barty.


He had fallen back, crossing his arms, smiling from ear to ear with that goddamn gap, watching my routine, my leaping and my waving. And he saw me, I thought, he really saw me. For the very first time in my entire life, someone saw me. He laughed again, and with it, I found myself buzzing.


I fell into him completely, then, wrapping arms around his shoulders and tugging him into an odd, exuberant half-dance. We laughed, and we leapt, all arms and legs. When we leaned in closer, I too could see him, the sublime way the moon played on his face, and I thought, I really let myself think, I mean, that I could have kissed him. And he would have let me.


But we knew who we were. And we knew where we were. I fell back. He did not, not just yet. But Aunt Rosie barrelled through the door to the backroom, looking from me to Barty and then back again. She huffed as we separated. 


“There you are, Dom! What are you, roughhousing? Today of all days? Hurry. We’re all gonna go over to your folks’ and watch the television.”


“Coming, Ro,” I said, and as she disappeared inside again, I met Barty’s eye.


“Hey, you better get going. Tonight’s the big night, right? Yesterday was just yesterday, but tomorrow, everything will be different. I don’t know what’s happening tomorrow.” He fell silent, his brow furrowing. “You know, everythings’ gotta be the way it was first. And then, one day it can all be different. That’s how it goes.”


“Yeah. Anything can happen now, can’t it? ‘Cause they were up there. Maybe.” As I turned to leave, I looked back, managing an uncertain smile. “I hope you catch that monster, Barty. There’s men on the moon, so.…”


“There are. Happy birthday, spaceman.” 


And this would be a moment, I realized. From here on out, there would be everything before it and everything after it. I’d just launched; I wondered when my Eagle would land. `

    description:`Where Time Almost Stands Still


Ok, how do we start this story? We could start it with character descriptions…nah. That’s on you and your imagination. We could write a beautiful description of atmosphere and breathtaking elements…nah, not going to happen. Hmmm, then how…? Fuck it, let’s just go.


Cole Johnson’s Entries:

Day 104:

I went to court today. It was some good, some bad. I was offered 24 years. That’s good. I won’t see Sally or my children for 8,760 days. That’s bad. This is a decision I must absorb. My attorney says it’s the best I will get and advises I take it. I won’t, I did not do anything wrong!

Today is chicken on the bone day, so I’m going to be quick in my documentation of my thoughts to you, world. Phillip will be done working out soon too. This place is so hard but at least I have Sally’s calls to look forward to. World, if you have an ounce of compassion, please forgive me. I did nothing wrong.


As Cole finished his diary entry, he knew it was close to chow time and he had his chicken already sold. It was a different kind of currency behind these walls. Instead of dollars and cents, it was items like soup and peanut butter. Chicken went for 5 soups, which was considered to be very expensive. We will talk about this again.


Day 162:

I talked to Sally today. She’s so amazing. I really miss her caress. Her lustful look, that she always had when she gazed upon me. She had eyes that you could feel deep in your heart. They were inviting. I could see she was deep in thought about me and I could almost reach into them and pull her soul into mine.

We talked about our normal topics at first, bills, her work, our longing for each other. The one thing we never discussed was my crime or my potential sentence. I know what’s coming and she does as well. I told her how much I missed her, we recalled our first date, for the five hundredth time, but it was a story that made us both smile and laugh. These memories were all we had now.


Cole had to get 16 soups, 4 honey buns and 2 bags of Dorito’s together. He had run up a debt, expecting Sally to help him with commissary. This debt was caused by the paper and pen he negotiated for, which was hard to acquire in this place. He wanted to write Sally letters, as well as, his children. Although, there were other ways to earn items when you’re broke, we will not get into that unpleasantness right now. 


Day 315:

I finally acquired a pen! These golf pencils are only good for writing these entries. Not really meant for the long letters I want to write for my children and Sally. Baby momma will no longer let the children take my calls, so getting this pen now was perfect timing! Question is, will the price I paid for it, come back to haunt me?

In here, debt is bad so I don’t know what will happen. I need to sell more Spice, but I have been transferred to the 600 block, which is all Pisa and folks that don’t do drugs. Ugh! It’s always something! I guess I will write my children. It has been over 60 days since we spoke. I really hope their mom reads these letters to my kiddos.


Cole had procured that pen at a great cost. Pretty much all of his commissary, so he had to reach out to others to try and get the funds so he could get more commissary. This was not on his top 10 list of favorite things to do. He would have to call his brother. His mother was just a poor waitress, so his only other option was his brother. 

Cole’s mentality was changing inside those walls. Never before would he even have fathomed begging his brother. He always found a way to get things on his own, now everything was different, he was dependent on help from outside these walls and barbed wire fences.


Day 461: 

I am losing all love, it feels like. All I see is hate, greed and controlled movements. The only thing I have anymore is Sally. She has been sick so much lately, that she has not been able to help much. Our phone calls are spread out now and have become less frequent, due to the financial burdens I bring.

I am contemplating letting her go. We will never make love, touch or even be allowed to see each other face to face given our great distance. She will never be able to afford that trip. Also, no letters from children, I am truly alone. People think they understand this world, but they don’t. Why do I deserve this? What did I do?


Cole was disappearing now. As the world got faster on the outside, in those walls time almost stood still. Everyday on the outside, new cars are bought, birthdays are celebrated, technologies are created, kisses are given and life is moving. In here, the most simple things cease to exist.


Day 936:

As I write to you, world, my soul is disappearing. How will I ever be able to come back into you? My beard is long and I have encountered so many things I never knew one man could do to another. The sound of a man’s last gasp of breath, then he’s gone.

World, I still don’t understand what my crime against you was. Why did I get put in here? What was my crime that was so bad, that you felt all should be taken? The only light left for me is Sally. Her monthly call is enough to keep me from slipping into the dark abyss. She is to call at 6pm. I need to shower to prepare. I know she cannot see me, but I feel she does. She is my love, my life, my soulmate.


Cole went to shower and there was a group of men that was looking to retaliate for something he had no part in, but the fact he was there, was good enough for them. It was a wrong place, wrong time type of deal. 


Day 966:

World, as I write this entry, I can barely see due to the beating I took in the shower. I need your help. I missed my call with Sally. That’s all I could think about as the four men repeatedly stomped my skull. 

I have been in the infirmary and when I get out, I am looking at 60 days in the hole cause I won’t say who jumped me. So, I sit here and write which is all I have anymore. World, you’re the only one who hasn’t abandoned me. Can you hear me? All I need is a small sign to know that at least you are real. You and Sally are all I have. I need you world!


The beating Cole took was severe. It fractured his skull, broke 9 ribs and put him in the infirmary for 30 days. Due to his silence, he was going to be put in isolation for 60 days. In here, someone always has to pay. However, the hole was a lighter sentence than talking. Talking would have meant his life. 


Day 1027:

I’m back. My wounds are better. I’m still sore but I’m better. I will never regain the teeth that I lost. Now, every day when I look into the mirror (reflective film) taped to the wall, I get reminded of that missed phone call. 

I tried all day to call Sally collect, but it was not accepted. She probably found someone else. It’s for the best. She deserves to move past me. I’m only a grim anchor in her life, dragging down her happiness. I guess it’s just us now, world. Please send me some sign so I know you’re really listening. I am so lonely now world. Help me so I do not become the hate that surrounds me all of the time. 


As Cole struggled, all communication with Sally ceased now. He was all alone. He knew now, all control was gone. No word from his children, no nothing. He had only one choice now, to take the plea. He would never be able to prove his innocence. This was his life now.


Day 1643: 

Well, it’s time world, I am taking the plea. 24 years, 8760 days, 210,240 minutes, 12,614,400 seconds. I know now that the world (yes, you) will never forgive me. Even you have to let go of me. Now, it’s only these walls, this disparity. The only thing I have to look forward to is being consumed into this life. I will never admit my guilt in my heart. You, world, have let me go, so I must live only here now and continue to survive. World, goodbye, this will be my last entry. I must kill the Cole Johnson of my previous life and become the Cole Johnson behind the walls.


Years passed, then one day, a greying Cole looked under his mattress to find the journal. He picked it up and began to read. He could only sit and weep as he read words that still had a sliver of hope and moments of joy. It was an emotion that Cole had not felt in a long time. Those feelings of hope, love, ambition and the possibility of a future, were all gone now. He was covered in tattoos, not because they were cool, but because they told his story behind these walls of who he was and what he had done. 

As Cole held that journal and looked into that so called mirror, he didn’t recognize the man looking back at him. It was only a shell of himself. He decided to write in that journal once again.


Day 6142:

Well, world, it’s me again. I’m sure you don’t remember me. I’m the man who killed that family at that intersection on Christmas Eve many years ago. Remember me now? Why did you abandon me world? It has not been easy. I had to kill a man and I have been sentenced to death by lethal injection.

I have tried to write the one child that survived that fateful night long ago. He is older now and I guess has moved on. He will probably never forgive me. He will never be able to hug his sister, mother or father ever again. I will never be able to hold Sally again and it hurts so much. My execution has been scheduled for next Tuesday.

I guess this will be my last entry. World, please let the universe know that I am sorry and hopefully, you can find a cool section of hell for me.

If I could only see my love just one more time, hug my children one last time. I know now that’s not possible. I hope Johnny and Allison have forgiven me and had the life they deserve and are happy.


As Cole prepared to be sent into the universe, a correctional officer came into his cell to give him his last meal. He also handed him a letter. Cole stood, hoping it was a farewell from his children or maybe even Sally. As he looked at the envelope and he was terrified to open it. He had not seen or felt for so long and as he began to open it, the guard told him,

“We found this letter in your property Cole. We do not know why it was overlooked and we all thought you deserved to have it.”

The correctional officer left and as Cole opened it, he noticed it was old like him. It was from Sally. It read,


My Dearest Cole,

I know by the time you read this, I will be gone. It turned out the reason I have been so sick lately, was because of the aggressive cancer inside of me. The doctors have given me only weeks to live. I am so sorry baby. I cannot stop it. I want to tell you how much I love you. I know someday we will be together in the stars. My love, I hope this letter finds you with compassion, not fear. Everything will be ok Cole. Even in death, I will not let go of you. I will always watch over you, my Cole. Please forgive me for leaving you. I love you so much. The doctors are coming. If I am able, I will write you again as soon as possible.

​​​​​Love your soulmate,

​​​​​Sally 


All Cole could do was fall to his knees. She was always with him. He thought he was talking to the world, but it was his Sally all along. `

    description:`Just one look at the penmanship, --- a solitary glance at those loopy, almost oblong letters, a furtive regard at the doughy circles dotting the small I’s --- and I feel a million glass butterflies flutter as they’re compacted inside of my stomach, their fragile, delicate wings catching on every tissue and cutting my insides. I’ve waited countless mornings of teardrops splattering into my tea, years of watching the postman like a hawk, for this blush-coloured piece of paper. Now, that it’s in my hands, her name resounds in my head once more, triggering reels of memories to be loaded in the cinema in my mind.


Anita Bowden. Anita Bowden of the long, luxurious burnt umber locks. Anita Bowden of the meadow eyes that glimmered like gems when talking about her work as a fashion magazine editor. Anita Bowden of the hairpin smiles every time she unleashed a razor-sharp comeback during our hours of banter, swinging in each other’s arms, and champagne-infused kisses over supper. Anita Bowden, whose hand I’ve held in the streets of the Latin Quarter, on the sands of Phuket, and on an Alpine ski lift…the same one that left a massive gap in mine the day she walked out the door without warning, her fuchsia suitcases rolling, two decades ago.


I swallow a gulp as I plunge into the words I’ve waited for twenty years to read.


**

Dearest Harold,


How are you? I do hope you’re well, Harry Hare. If there’s anyone that deserves all the flowers that the lush gardens of the life could offer, it truly is you.


Goodness, it’s been so long, hasn’t it? I wouldn’t know it, though, if I could be perfectly honest. Sure, the last time I heard that low, comforting velvet drone of your voice, we were so young. The world was still opening itself up like an oyster when we opened our hearts and selves up to each other. However, to me, all of it seems like only yesterday. The feeling of weightlessness from laughing because of one of your witty quips, inhaling the clean, almost marine scent of your aftershave as our hungry lips explored each other’s skin, our bodies undulating on a brightly lit dance floor and, after, in bed in the glow of a honey-tinged moonlight --- all of that is fresh in my consciousness as the break of day. I guess that’s because all those memories have you marinated in them, and my soul won’t ever forget you.


**

Almost half of my lifetime, that’s precisely how much I had been agonising as I searched for even just one clipped, curt sentence from Anita. All this time, I held a glass of whiskey in hand as I recalled her aria of a chuckle, her petunia lipstick leaving a mark on my mouth as I blissfully drowned in her scent of pear and freesia, her pirouetting in my arms feeling like the entire universe had fallen away. 


Twenty years, and Anita is still dancing in my mind. I just never knew that I was doing just the same in hers.

**

Harold, do you know that every time I’m on the beach, I think of you? Yes, every single moment that I feel that familiar powder touch of sand, the rough tickle of stone, leading to a brilliant, cool ocean, the first thing I picture is your aquamarine eyes and that shy grin as you and I raced across shores all around the world.


My favourite of these moments, though, is when you brought me back to Paignton to introduce me to your parents and your sister for your birthday. Oh, the candy floss-hued house façades, the vibrant emerald of the hills, the bubbly peals of children’s laughter as we passed by the fun rides of the pier, your meaty hand in mine as we strolled the coast, your mum’s tight embrace as she welcomed me for the first time to a Turner family dinner --- how all of them will never be washed away by the tides of time. No, I’m not going to ever let the memory of us two on a picnic blanket, plates of salty fish and chips on our laps and a little wooden cottage filled with love and our children near the waterfront in our plans, dissolve like seafoam. As far as I know, the waves will always resemble your smile.


Will anyone please take me back to that?

**

Until now, that trip back to my hometown plays on loop in my mind. I could still visualise in full, high-definition detail Anita’s marigold flounced sundress floating in the wind, her striding along the sable surface like a golden fairy. Just reading those words, and suddenly, I taste the acrid burn of the malt vinegar on those battered haddock pieces, see the explosion of fireworks in vermillion and chartreuse in my vision when her delicate, milky hand caressed mine. Once again, my toes squelch in Paignton’s seaboard as I imagine two chocolate-haired tykes with jades that stare back at me.


Yes, I want to come back to all those pelagic moments.

**

Of course, I just can’t help either ruminating on that glorious, magical night in Montmartre. Yes, I could still hear the enchanting sound of the accordions serenading us in that bistrot, taste the rich, bold flavours of pears poached in red wine and, especially so, your soft lips on mine.


You asked me to pack that long, pistachio wrap dress, the one you adored and always said was the perfect pair to my eyes, for the night. When we boarded the car you’d hired and handed me a bouquet of bright pink tulips, I should have known you would make that evening sparkle forever in my mind…. for many reasons.


Little did I know that you asked owners of every single shop we passed by on the way to the Sacré Cœur to hand me even more blooms to add to the cornucopia in my arms. Little did I know that you hired a string quartet to play our song, ‘That’s All’ by Johnny Mathis as we twirled on cobblestone streets. Little did I know that hidden in the pocket of your tweed trousers was the art deco emerald engagement ring that’s been with your family for three generations.


Of course, I had to leap into your arms and pepper your handsome visage with kisses to respond with a resounding yes. That night, hand-in-hand, we walked into a future more glittering than the lights of The Eiffel Tower.

**

I can’t help stifling the smile creeping on my face like a vine as I travel back to my hands wringing in nervousness as we took that Eurostar to Paris. I’d planned how to ask Anita to be my wife for five long, gruelling months. I’d thought of everything: from the reservations for a table in the City of Lights’ hot new eatery to the pine-coloured buttons of the quartet’s jackets. It all became worth it, though, as I slipped that family heirloom on Anita’s delicate left ring finger. As I stared into her green eyes, I couldn’t help seeing forever in them.


It was perfect…. until it wasn’t.

**

… and then, I had to go ruin everything, didn’t I? 


I don’t know what came over me to even think of leaving you, breaking up with the man I know I’ve waited all my life for, and going with Jamie Ormond. How could I fly away from the person who makes me feel like I’m soaring for he who treated me as a mere trophy in his cupboard? Harold, you had given me a universe of the brightest stars. Did I really give it up just because Jamie promised me an editor-in-chief title?


I’m so very sorry. Harold, I know I hurt you when out-of-the-blue, I walked away from you. That’s what cuts me into a million pieces, to know that I had brought so much pain to you who had offered me nothing but the purest of joy. You have every right to hate me, but I do hope you could forgive me. 

**

I haven’t forgotten either the sting of watching Anita roll those suitcases out of the flat we shared with nary a word to explain her departure. I tried to dig in, find the well of statements that desperately wanted to revive the tree of our love. In the end, though, my throat was as dry as the Sahara. Right before my eyes, she was gone, and I watched my insides shrivel up and wither.


For years, I waited for even just a single syllable from her, a breathy sound to tell me that she wanted me back. Of course, the whites of my eyes had overtaken the blue and still, no missive came for me. 


Until now. Of course, though…

**

It’s probably too late, though. Yes, I saw your photo with Kate on The Telegraph. 


Kate Parsons. I never thought you’d marry her, the girl your parents had always pushed you towards. Then again, I shouldn’t be surprised. Beautiful Kate with her fair hair and stunning amber eyes. Intelligent Kate with her double master’s degree in linguistics and art history. Kate, the best-selling author whose novels barely stay on the shelves at Waterstones before being sold out. Kate, the chairperson of a charity that gives scholarships to promising teenagers so they could pursue a career in the arts.


I could see why you love her. That wide grin in that newspaper image tells me that next to her, you are as boundless as the sapphire ocean…and that any chance for you to come back to me is lost like sand washed away by the tide. 


But if ever you change your mind, if that seaside cottage and you and I strolling on the shores is still fresh in your memory, I will be here. 


Harold Arthur Turner, it’s you I’ve waited for; I could wait a lifetime more to have another shot with you.


Drowning in a sea of regret,

Anita

**

I glance at the chrome frames in my office’s bookshelf, all chronicling a quarter of a century of one woman standing by my side like a pillar withstanding the crests and troughs of time.


Kate. The woman I admittedly started going out with in a desperate move after Anita left, but whose calm, steady presence had made wildflowers of affection grow in my heart. The rich, nourishing soil I’ve rooted myself in, fully knowing her soft, silken voice and those large aureate eyes will always be my home. My bedrock that no waters could erode.


Kate, the woman I choose. Kate…


‘Uhm, Harold?’


I turn towards my beautiful wife in her favourite dress with the delicate fern fronds printed on it. Her long, blonde waves are coiffed perfectly without a single strand out of place. In her hand is a sheet of folded lavender paper.


‘Hey, you’re going somewhere,' I ask.


‘Yeah, Tom’s in town. Remember him? Tom Selfridge, my…uh…best mate? Well, he wants to meet up at Sudeley’s for a catch-up supper.’


‘Oh, that’s nice of him. Do give him a hello from me.'


‘I…uh…will.’


‘Hey, your eyes, they look a bit red. What’s going on?’


‘Oh…uh...I…have allergies…yeah... allergies. Don’t worry. I’ll be okay.’


‘Okay, well, I hope you’ll soon be on the mend, darling. I guess that’s why you’re not wearing your wedding band. You don’t want to aggravate your condition?’


‘Y-yeah. That’s… that’s precisely it. I just want to take precautions.’


‘Well, have fun, okay. I’ll be here, waiting for you.’


‘I…I’m sure you will be.’`
