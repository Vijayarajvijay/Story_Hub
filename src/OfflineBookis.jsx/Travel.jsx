    description:`Munching on a special bhel near the Lumbini bus stand, I was irked by the strong taste of mustard oil in it and was also preparing myself to travel in a jam-packed bus to Kathmandu. And at the back of my mind, I was praying God to send a lady passenger in the next seat so that I can have a peaceful sleep without much worry. Though, Nepal is quite safe when it comes to solo female travel no matter which country you are from, what you are wearing.

‚Äú I arranged girl sit with girl sit, ok mam?‚Äù a person in charge informed us in ‚Äòhis‚Äô English and did this without even asking for it ! (God really listens? Hahah)

A crazy selfie with Julie at the square‚Ä¶
‚Äú Hey.. I am Julie‚Äù‚Ä¶ she introduced herself and after a not so formal conversation, we started the discussion about her 2 months travel and solo trekking in Nepal and my solo travelling in India. Did I want anything more than a likeminded crazy partner in my journey? We tried to sleep in between our chirping but the bus stopped at almost every few minutes. And the exchange of the horrible and the amazing travel experiences continued. And we didn‚Äôt realise when the colour of our surrounding turned hazy grey from jade black.

It was the time to bid goodbye.. wait, NO. The moment I shared my plan of exploring Kathmandu on a bike, Julie had already planned to join me. Now, 2 girls who met just a night before were getting ready at a hostel in Thamel. It was she who had booked the hostel. I was on money-saving mode, I just got fresh and had a bath in the hostel. And soon after that, we were binging on some brownie and dark Nepali coffee before starting our adventure.

Dealing with the bike without my passport was another story, but in search of a cheap bike, we had already roamed around the colourful markets of Thamel. Somewhere in the streets of Thamel, the ladies cooked hot jalebis in the tiny rooms while many other prepared some steaming hot tea.

Pashupatinath Temple
Leaving behind the streets for a while we got on our horse scooter, straight we rode to Pashupatinath Temple before it turned too crowded.

The temple looked quite ordinary when observed from outside. I didn‚Äôt really have to be in the queue (sometimes just a smile works, you see üòâ ) and what I saw on entering the temple was like a scene from some artificial set of a South Indian Movie. Finely carved and embossed designed on faded silver idols, huge statues of guards and the huge ‚Äòyagya Kund‚Äô created a perfectly divine scenery. While standing right at the entrance, I was more engrossed in staring at the figures carved on the doorway. I could hardly recognise any except the ‚ÄòNandi‚Äô, Vishnu and a few other Gods. The shivling of Pashupatinath is four headed and blesses the devotees from all the four of the doors of the main temple. I really felt the need for the camera right now. But, forget the camera not even an umbrella was allowed in.

Bagmati River Bank at Pashupatinath Temple Complex
Moving further is a temple of ‚ÄòNagraaj‚Äô , it is also a unique feature of this temple, which is never seen in any other Shiv temples. Further, the temples of Ganga and Vishnu are also interesting. The complex is spread in a huge area housing many small temples with Pashupatinath at its centre. Moving further, I saw a few shivling lying among the debris. And the nearby building had also collapsed. The pandit in the temple intimated me about the destruction caused by the earthquake. But the astonishing fact is that it didn‚Äôt affect the main shrine at all !

Moving further at the backside of the temple, the river Bagmati flows leisurely, carrying all the auspicious flowers and ashes of the rituals. The monks sitting on the banks and the fuming ‚Äòyagya kund‚Äô makes a perfect picture for any photographers.

Patan Square
Passing by the palatial building with fine wooden carving, we didn‚Äôt realise when we reached Patan completing a long journey on a sunny day. The cultural capital of Nepal, Patan is a hub for culture lovers. If you have any interest in fine architecture, metal craft and painting then you must head to Patan.

Kathmandu Darbar Square and Market
see visit explore kathmandu living goddess Nepal

The craftsmen‚Äôs market, curious stares of the travellers at the dilapidated but stunning structures, Nepali teens chilling around sitting on the platforms of the temples and the 4 pm rush at the Kumari house‚Ä¶ This describes the Darbar Square in Kathmandu perfectly. Moving through the rush in the markets, you would reach an open area dotted with only Nepali style wooden structures. The main building includes the Palace of the Kings of Nepal, Kumari Niwas and the temples of Hindu Gods.

Have Glimpse of the Living Goddess
If you are confused who and what ‚ÄòKumari‚Äô is, then you can be surprised to know that Nepal has the tradition of worshipping a Living Goddess. Every few years, a girl is chosen from the royal region of Nepal who has a lioness like chest, deer-like legs and sharp eyes. The girl is then, through a ritual, declared the Goddess of Nepal. The current Kumari is just a 4 years old kid.

Waiting for just one glimpse of her, our eyes were fixed on an intricate balcony from where the Goddess was supposed to give ‚Äòdarshan‚Äô to the people who had come from all over the world.

It was sharp 4 pm, the sun was about to set and the tinkling anklets indicated the playful presence of the Kumari inside the impressive heritage building. All were instructed to stand up in order to respect the Goddess and the guides turned quite vigilant to ensure that nobody clicked her pictures.

The Crowd in the Kumari Mahal Courtyard that has gathered just for a glimpse of the living Goddess of Nepal
We kept gazing, waiting for the curtain to open. And then I could hear an overextended ‚ÄòAwww‚Äô of the visitors.  We could see a little girl who wore sharp eyeliner making her deer-like eyes look fiercer. Her bun was tied too tight creating unusual stretching of hair root and forming a design around her innocent face. Wearing the bangles, a colourful attire and a bindi, she might have thought it to be a game where she gets to have a glimpse of the world that existed outside her fancy building. Certainly, the cuteness of the little girl left everyone in awe.

The Kumari of Nepal might develop a desire to roam around and mingle with the school friends or play a game with the kids of her age, but alas! She was vested upon a title that she had to grace. She had to follow her responsibility of being a Goddess who doesn‚Äôt step out of the house till she reaches puberty. She has the power of being a goddess but she has to sacrifice her childhood. Wait, would she even know what childhood and the fun of childhood is? A series of such thoughts of concern about a child‚Äôs right ran through my mind. I saw Julie and other people staring blankly at the kid, probably they had the same thoughts as I had. And then suddenly, there was a chuckle in the crowd. Apparently, the goddess was waving back at the tourists and the childlike act of her made them laugh at her innocence.

She was constantly being guided by a caretaker who seemed to be training her to act as a Goddess. In a few minutes, the Goddess was again put behind the bars curtains. And again, the Kumari Niwas was left deserted by the tourists.

We moved out and clicked the pictures of the row of ancient temples and buildings at the temple, and suddenly a guard asked us if we had the entry ticket (?). We had entered in the area clicking the pictures of the market as there was no one at the counter. We either had to move out or Julie had to pay 1000 NR and I had to pay 250 NR, but we were high on craziness. We just mislead him, jumped off a platform behind the temple and again entered the area. Yes, we barged in without the tickets üòâ And had also had the glimpse of the goddess that certainly required the same ticket.

A Scene at the Darbar Square ‚Äì Kathmandu
This time, the eye-catching scene was of a giant idol of Kaal Bhairva who was being worshipped at the square. Then came the temples of Taleju Goddess, Indrapur and Lord Shiva. I really could not focus on any of the Gods but the pyramid-shaped towers of the temple that seemed to be reaching for the clouds.

The square looked less touristy now and more like a hangout place for the teens of Nepal. And there we were, successfully moving out without being caught again and we had a great laugh at our insane act.

We hadn‚Äôt had proper sleep the last night, but still, our enthusiasm to explore wasn‚Äôt affected even a bit, the craziness continued as I made her eat some Dahi puri and bhel in a local shop in Kathmandu. And she liked it so much that we ordered almost all the chaats on the list.

And she dropped me at the bus stop again bidding a farewell but with a promise to meet again, and the next time at her place.

Wait till I write my experience with Julie in Paris. She would be hosting me in April 2018.

This is what solo travelling does to you. It makes you trust the strangers and even gives you a friend for a lifetime.

Did you ever have such experience while travelling solo? Share it in the comment‚Ä¶..

Travel Tips

The easiest way to travel around is by renting a bike. Your passport has to be submitted for renting any kind of bike.
The bike rates range from 600 NR to 1200 NR depending on the condition and type of the two-wheeler.
If you are a backpacker, the hostels at Paknajol Street in Thamel area is the right place for you.
Kathmandu can be reached in an overnight journey from Pokhra and even from Lumbini.
You may be lucky to get some clothes at a cheaper price. But there is no point. Most of the garments are costly as the taxes are added on their import from India and Thailand.
The living goddess can be seen only at 4 pm at Kumari Mahal.

    description:`Ladakh for a month?

Are you out of your mind? What would you do for a month?

What is there to see for a month?

After hearing this from almost everyone, I was firm to explore the unseen Ladakh with all the more enthusiasm. And I have now ended up planning another visit to this Land of Lamas because a month was certainly not enough to explore the secrets of this fairyland.

Living the life on the road is a dream for many. And when it comes to solo traveling, most of them think it to be insane. But my solo traveling in Ladakh would give you the real picture of what solo traveling actually looks like

Solo Travel In Ladakh
The people of Ladakh have made my solo travel all the more interesting. Being a solo traveler, I could meet so many beautiful souls on the go and could even explore some off beat ‚Äòstrictly for a traveling soul‚Äô haunts. A fixed itinerary to Ladakh would just ruin your traveling and you won‚Äôt be able to experience the essence of any place that you would stumble upon.


When you travel solo, you also learn the art of taking the best selfies. That is the village of Kukshow, a hidden jewel of Ladakh
I had roughly planned for a few places before landing at Leh and then I just moved on the advice of the locals I met. The people were so generous that they did not only let me stay in their homes but also had been the best hosts ever. The Ladakhi mothers literally didn‚Äôt let me feel that I was away from home and mom. Fresh milk, khambhir cooked on chulha and butter tea would be fed every morning with utmost love.

The people, many a time, were worried when I denied having butter tea. With all the zeal they would jump up to make ‚Äòmitha chai‚Äò (milk tea) for me. When I would deny even for that, they would discuss among themselves about what they could offer me. In one of the brokpa villages, an old lady was so sad that I did not have lunch or tea at their home. She thus went all the way to a distant neighbour‚Äôs house who had stored some dried apricots and brought it just for me. She, with a peculiarly broad smile, offered it to me saying that I cannot deny eating apricots. üôÇ Obviously, I couldn‚Äôt deny!

Not even once I was advised that I should not travel alone. Honestly, I have felt Ladakh to be the safest place for the female solo travelers.

Against all the prevailing norms of what ‚Äò a lone girl shouldn‚Äôt be doing‚Äô, I hitch-hiked, hiked alone and even stayed at unknown people‚Äôs place without any fear.

I had read somewhere that the main causes of all diseases are fear, tension, and anger. While traveling in Ladakh I had no tension or fear of anything and this kept the evil named anger far away from my untamed mind. In fact, a few of them told me that they hardly feel the need of any doctor or hospital. The people here grow their own organic food in their fields, be with nature, stay happy and thus are living a peaceful and contended life.

Ladakh is a dreamland which is still untouched by the evils of modernization. And I had the best experience of it during my month-long traveling in the interiors.

This post is my tribute to all the amazing souls I met during my journey. Here is why my journey became a life-time memory.


With Sonam Rigzin and his Aunt
Hanu Thang
At 3 pm on a hot sunny day, I was waiting at Indus Cafe, for some vehicle that can drop me up till Hanu Gongma. Indus Cafe, on the way to Kargil via Aryan Valley, is run by Indian army and they provide hot and spicy samosas, momos and vadas in the land where nobody knows what spices mean to the other Indians down the hills. Here, I met Sonam Rigzin, the expert cook working for this cafe. After talking for a while, he cordially invited me to his place, to know more about the Brokpa culture.

It is a tribe that is secretly preserving its rich culture in the Ladakhi Himalayas. He also sent me along with his friend to the forbidden land where Indian Army might not allow other tourists. Apparently, I was the only outsider at Hanu Gongma and Hanu Yokma. But, thanx to Sonam Rigzin, I was treated like a VIP guest wherever I went in the village. His uncle who had studied and worked in Mumbai was a great source of information about the declining Brokpa culture and the newly developing mixed culture in the village of  Hanu. Theirs is the only proper homestay available in this village.

The lady sitting beside was my Brokpa model for the day. She took all the efforts to make 12 plaits of her hair and dressed up like a proper Brokpa lady, just for a perfect photograph for me.

And yes, I am already invited for the Brokpa marriages to be held the coming winter. üòâ


Ishey and Dolkar, the teachers at a school in Hanu Yokma
Heading ahead towards the Dard Villages
The whole day I was just bored and could hardly understand the language of the locals at Hanu. Finally, in the evening, when Sonam Rigzin invited me to come down to the main kitchen of the house, I met these lovely ladies who were almost my carbon copies. These teachers became friends of mine just while discussing ‚Äòour‚Äô profession while the delicious Ladakhi food was being prepared by our landlady. To be precise, we would have talked for around 3 -4 hours continuously. I wish we had had more time to have more fun. I am going to meet them again by the end of this year. üôÇ Who knew I would get to meet such long-lost friends in a village that doesn‚Äôt even have land line phones.

My friend Diskit on the extreme right and another Brokpa lady in the middle. This was our little kitty party at Payupa House in Garkone village.
Living With a Dard Family at Garkone
My next destination was the beautiful village of Garkone. Thanx to instagram, I already knew about the Payupa family at Garkone. After visiting their ancestral house, we cooked food together and talked about the customs of the village. By evening, the people kept on visiting for some ‚ÄòChai pe Charcha‚Äò. Each visitor enthusiastically sang and explained me a historic song of this unique Aryan culture. We had a great fun having a photo shoot with that flowery Brokpa cap. Even Diskit sang a sweet song for me. It was a really a memorable day here with Diskit and her cute little daughters who are missing in the picture.


Singh Sahab and the Parties
Darchik
‚ÄúShould I be submitting my permit to you, sir?‚Äù, I asked him with extra politeness. And this was how I met this great army officer whom I would call Singh Sir. He didn‚Äôt only help me with my aim but also showed a keen interest in what I was researching about. For around half and hour he keenly listened to all the stories of Brokpas and then asked me what would I take in return of the knowledge he had gathered from me. Such politeness and modesty from an army man were really least expected. (All the while I was just under the impression that I was being enquired suspiciously :P)

The stay, food, and meeting with the researchers and singers at Darchik was all arranged willingly by him. Later on, I came to know that he had also instructed a few people in the village that I should be provided proper lunch and dinner. I would never forget the dairy milk and biscuits he gifted me and asked me to keep up the energy as I would need it during my exploration.

The rest of the time at Darchik became an unforgettable part of my journey. Scroll to know more.


Mr. Sadiq Ali AKA Changez Khan and the brown eyed brokpa kids
A Day at a School in Darchik
‚ÄúWhat would he even know about our culture, he is an outsider,‚Äù commented a local lady when Singh Sir asked me to meet Sadiq Ali. He is a teacher in the middle school at Darchik. After meeting him, I came to know that we were sailing in the same boat and were researching on the same topic of Brokpa songs and customs. The following day I stayed at their place, cooked some spicy fried rice and had a long discussion about the history narrated in the Brokpa songs.

It was a random decision to stay for an extra day at Darchik and visit the school to teach them some basic English conversation. (Can‚Äôt stop being a teacher, after all)

Mr. Ali has just joined the school a few months ago and has already brought revolutionary changes by installing sports equipment in the playground, colouring the walls and beautifying it with inspiring quotes.

The next evening we went up till the last village before Pakistan towards Batalik region. The venture was followed by an adventure of climbing up a rocky hill in the village named Gargardo, just to meet a singer in search of some unheard stories of the Dards (Brokpas) and songs.


On the way to Kargil, an unplanned destination on my route
I never thought of visiting Kargil just for the Vijay Smarak.  But thanx to these people, I ended up staying there for around 2 days. We explored all the nooks and corners of this place having an interesting history. Only with their guidance, I could explore the unseen parts and unknown facts about Kargil.


‚ÄòChai Pe Charcha‚Äô was followed by a delicious dinner party with Yangchen Dolkar
Yangchen Dolkar is the first female Educator to start a school in Kargil. Her secular school is indeed an inspiration for the entire nation. She joined our gang for Kargil exploration and as it said, more the merrier. üòâ


@Pakistan with Changez Khan üòõ
Our gang then reached the Pakistan border at Kargil, what you can see in the background of this picture is the POK (Pakistan Occupied Kashmir). With my extra zoom camera, I could literally see the Pak soldiers‚Äô movement in the desolate village which was once a part of Kargil.

@Hunder Man, the last Village at Indo-Pak border in Kargil.
Hunder Man was the lost part of Kargil which was retrieved by the Indian army in the year 1971. We could explore the ancient settlement which is still untouched by so-called development and modern facilities. The stone houses here are still kept intact and preserved as a precious heritage of the village. Sadiq Ali was an integral part of the team that helped in the restoration of this village which was neglected for years. It has been accessible for the Indian tourists only since past 2 years.

solo travel ladakh
Outside the shelter that was used by the villagers during the war of 1971.
Suleman Khan, a localite from the village took us to the shelter where the whole village had to stay during the war of 1971. He narrated the spine chilling stories of being undertaken by the Indian Army. Listening to his experience of being in Pakistan and surviving the war left us all speechless. We then revived his good memories of having lunch and dinner with the whole village right at this place, while the armies of both the countries were busy attacking each other. While having juice and chips, we listened to his stories of bringing food from a common kitchen for all the people who had to hide inside the shell.


With the family of Changez Khan (Sadiq Ali)
With a Purgi Family at Kargil
Kashmiris are conservative and reserved, is what I had heard from the people. But, this wrong notion was soon dispelled as I met a few of the families in Kargil. They were as proud Indian as any soldier might be. Sadiq‚Äôs family welcomed Yangchen and me with great warmth. We were offered the traditional dishes like kholak and sattu especially made for us by Sadiq‚Äôs mother. Not even for a moment did I feel that I was sitting among any conservative family.  Sadiq‚Äôs elder brother, who is a part of the ministry of renewable energy, talked about how they are working towards the development of the nation. He indeed seemed to be a great visionary.

Kargil was another memorable picture in the reel of my journey. The next day Yangchen dropped me to Khangral and from there I hitch-hiked till Abapa House in Chiktan, a village with the most fascinating history and the architecture.


With the Abapa‚Äôs family at Chiktan
With Abapa Family at Chiktan
The children of Abapa family are really the bundles of talents. While Tsanzin just completed his Grade X exam from Leh, he also knows how to grow organic food on his farm and cook some lip-smacking dishes. That day he cooked potato ‚Äì capsicum while his mother made Ladakhi rotis. The other son has learned the art of building mud houses. He travels around teaching the same to other artists and has a plan to build a meditation center only using the mud bricks. The interesting thing about this family is that they are the only Buddhists in this Muslim town and still never feel to be an odd one out.


With Sonam Palghis, the Messiah for the day
Heading to Kukshow on a Lone Road
The next day, I had to move to Kukshow, which was just 21 km from Chiktan. I was told that the road is very difficult to cover by walking and I would not find a single vehicle that can drop me. My adventurous mind denied listening to anything and I headed towards Kukshow, all tired just after walking for around 20 minutes. The workers at the last house of the town told me that even those who regularly travel to Kukshow had already left. I hardly had any hopes and started moving on the steep roads with only the mountains in my sight.

I was still chanting mantras under my heavy breaths and was trying to please Lord Shiva for some help on this desolate path. As usual, my prayers didn‚Äôt go unheard and God sent a Messiah in the form of this man. Sonam Palghis was moving back to Kukshow after dropping a few of his relatives to Chiktan. He turned out to be a distant relative of the Abapa family and insisted that I be the guest at his sweet home. The village of Kukshow doesn‚Äôt have a single guest house and thus, his invitation was like God calling me to stay in heaven as there was nothing else beyond the 7th sky. üôÇ

With Sonam Palghis and his family
At Kukshow ‚Äì Abodhi Muslim Village
This was the sweetest family ever. His wife was like my most caring mother for the day. She made it sure that I eat properly before starting my hike to Dargo village till Achinathang. She packed a few chapatis and bananas for me to eat on the way. ‚ÄúGod knows when would you reach Dargo and whether you would get anything to eat or not,‚Äù she said in Ladakhi which was then translated by her son.

After walking continuously for around four and a half hours, I finally reached to see the miraculous spring water source at Dargo. Needless to say, I was the only living being on my way. Not even a dog or a cow could be seen during this long tiring walk with all my luggage on. (So getting any vehicle was far beyond expectation.) From there, I still had to walk for around an hour to reach Sonam Phuntsog‚Äôs place in Achinathang.

At Achinathang With Sonam Phuntsog

‚ÄúIf you really wish to know about our History, meet Sonam Phuntsog,‚Äù said whosoever I met. So, I spared a day to meet this great man and discuss some interesting facts. His knowledge about Ladakh and its culture is indeed unbelievable. At the age of 80, he went all the way walking up to the main village just to get a book weighing around 10 kg for my reference. The book written by Wazir Hazmatullah Khan in 1936 was really a treasure of historical information. We spent the whole day discussing the Brokpa culture and the historic establishment of the villages of Dargo, Kukshow, and Chiktan.

The Saviours from Maharashtra
Hitchhiking Stories
I easily reached my next destination by hitch-hiking upto Khaltsi and then to Lamayaru from Achinathang. There, I even handled the shop of my home stay owner for a few hours. (I could sell three bottles of minute-maid :-P, I bleed Gujju after all)  The next morning, I left early considering that I wished to reach Leh as early as possible. The destiny certainly didn‚Äôt want me to go as per my plan.

My adventure started when I boarded a car going in the opposite direction‚Ä¶ I had reached half way till Kargil when I realized that I had taken the wrong route. But this mistake of mine took me to Fotula Pass, which I would have missed otherwise. When I got down at Khangral, there was only one human being I could see working in his field. There was no bus going to Leh in next few hours. I tried to stop a few vehicles but none of them were going to Leh or Lamayuru.

Then came the troupe of these saviors from Maharashtra who was on their leisure trip in Ladakh. I boarded their vehicle and had fun laughing at their jokes and comments. Not to mention the old melodies sung by these lovely people. I even vomited on the way, but Ms. Doctor in the bus immediately came to my rescue with medication.

I bade them adieu at Lamayaru as they proceeded towards the monastery. I again had to wait for another vehicle to move towards Leh. This time I opted for a truck that moved at the speed of a snail. I eventually had to board another car in order to reach on time.

Tashi Angchok and his family at Choglamsar Village near Leh
And finally, I reached Leh to meet this crazy family of Tashi Angchok. He was the guide behind my offbeat exploration in Ladakh. The mornings here were spent gazing at the sparkling peak of Stok Kangri right from my room window and writing about my journey. The afternoons were even more enjoyable as I cooked the lunch of my wish and talked for hours to Tashi‚Äôs mother who didn‚Äôt understand even the ‚ÄòH‚Äô of Hindi. üôÇ But that was the real fun. We both kept on talking in our own language and ended up laughing at each other as we wouldn‚Äôt understand anything. One day I had even kneaded the dough of sattu believing it to be the wheat flour. (the whole dough then had to be given to the cow üòê )

The evenings would be spent with the naughty kids showing their talent in fighting like Bruce Lee or singing some Bollywood movie songs.

Abapa Homestay at Leh

By the time I took this last picture of my journey, this little heroine had already fallen asleep. She really is a drama queen. I was always entertained with some dance moves and acts by her. This picture is clicked after I asked her to command GoPro to take a nice picture of us. She commanded in her kiddish Ladakhi tone, ‚ÄúGo Pou, take a Phoutooo,‚Äù accompanied by the above expressions. Hahaha, I would soon upload some cute videos of these crazy kids.

It was really hard to leave this place, not just because it is beautiful, but I was now much attached to the land and its people.

Obviously, a traveler can‚Äôt choose to just stay in one place, and thus I had to start my journey to Manali where I would be volunteering for a few months with the Healing Himalayas Foundation.`

    description:`Warm cozy bed, soft light and mild soothing cold; a perfect setting to make me lazy enough not to move out my bed despite being aware of an interesting village outside, that might be wide awake busy with their daily chores. Gathering all my strength, when I opened the door of my room‚Äôs balcony, I was wished a lovely morning by the hazy fog spread over the garden. The smell of the wet mud and misty air were all the more refreshing. And the fresh dewdrops made the red roses in the garden look glittery. And to fulfil the need of the background music to this fanciful scenery, Indian Magpie, sunbirds and Indian Rollers chirped in the sweetest way and reminded me of the imaginary fairyland described in some childhood stories.

Ah! I couldn‚Äôt have asked more for an escape from my city explorations in India which had made me completely exhausted. The lazy morning at Faagun Haveli, nestled among the farms of Gundrai village in Orchha was a perfect place for me.

The hot breakfast and the warm smiles of the doting staff of the Haveli filled me with some energy to go for a ramble in the village that looked like a green carpet with flourishing crops.

As I took a turn from the Haveli‚Äôs gate, I was welcomed by a typical village scene with all the animals moving off for grazing, the ladies working in their farms and a few of them cleaning the grains in a traditional way which is nowadays a rare practice.

‚ÄúPhotu lelo photu,‚Äù (Click our picture) the villagers seemed quite elated at the arrival of a traveller with a camera in her hand. They tried posing for me, but my camera found their candid gestures more beautiful. The kids came running wishing me morning. Probably, they were taught by their teachers, or they had just grasped it from the frequent visitors to their village, most of whom came from the Faagun Haveli.

Come, clean the wheat-grains with us,‚Äù I heard a woman calling me and it was followed by a giggle as they thought I couldn‚Äôt do that. But, there I was, my bare feet trailing towards them, stepping on the soft, dried wheat-pods and quickly I learnt the swinging method to separate the wheat from the other agricultural trash. While I was busy enjoying my new job, I could smell the burning wood and cow-dung, people kept on passing by with their cattle and the ladies of the house kept on talking to them while still doing their work. I wondered if we ever had such time and bonding with the neighbours in the cities. This scene was far more enjoyable than any get-together or kitty parties or.

After having bajra roti (bread) with maheri (a dish prepared by heating buttermilk), I headed to the interior part of the village. The houses looked unusually white and others stunningly blue. I am still curious and have hardly found a valid answer for the prevalence of only the white and the blue houses all over Bundelkhand.

The charpoys under the Neem tree, the street dogs and the kids of almost the whole village playing all around, is what a typical Indian village looks like. There were pits formed for the cows and buffalos almost outside each house and the village didn‚Äôt create any wet waste!

While clicking the pictures standing at the village square, I was invited to a house by a few kids. Obliging to their request, I quickly ran with them. While moving through their courtyard I observed the white painted squares on mud floors which I think were purposely kept for the ‚Äòrangoli‚Äô making custom. The walls had the paintings similar to those in the Lakshminarayan Temple of Orchha. Later would I come to know that the painting is the tradition of Bundelkhand and it is called Mandana.

Didi look here, this side we have cauliflowers and the other side is for the eggplant,‚Äô the kids were quite excited. I asked their names and turn by turn they all tried answering in English and had an immense confidence. They all wished to study but eventually none of them wanted to join any job and instead wished to be and work in their farms as they loved being there!

‚ÄòBaigan ka Bharta‚Äô (a spicy dish prepared with roasted eggplants) was what running at the back of my mind while the kids were explaining me about how well ripen the eggplants were. I plucked the soft ones for myself, which were supposed to be the best ones. They happily helped me in identifying the bright deep purple coloured ones which were soft enough to taste delicious.

I also cut the fresh coriander leaves from the other farm. And the leaves smelled strong. The kind of fragrance that I was longing for had finally stimulated my olfactory senses.

The Mysterious Temple of Chhardwari
The previous night, while enjoying the tranquillity of the surrounding wilderness, in my exquisite room at Faagun Haveli, I could hear the incessant chanting of ‚ÄòSita Ram‚Äô. Since then, my curious mind wished to know more about it. And thus, after spending almost 5-6 hours in the farms and the village, I headed further to the place that marked the end of the ancient kingdom of Orchha.

A small temple with a huge statue of Lord Hanuman, a step-well dating back to the reign of Maharaja Pahad Singh and the same unceasing chanting of ‚ÄòSita Ram‚Äô that continued since past 13 years; Wasn‚Äôt that an amazing example of inexplicable faith and fulfillment of an almost impossible vow of chanting the mantra (?) . Sitting beside the Pandit, I heard the interesting tales of Orchha and that of the temple, creatively put into poetic phrases. By this time, I was literally in awe of the history of Orchha that remained unaffected even during the Mughal and the British Era.

Apparently, the temple of Chhardwari was one of the four Hanuman temples in all the four directions of Orchha. And as per the historic tales, because of the blessings of Chhardwari Hanuman, the King of Orchha was able to win over the powerful kingdom of Gondwana.  The king, after his victory, had built this temple under his supervision. He neither went to his palace nor did he enjoy any royal luxury till the temple was built and till now, the temple lies hidden here at Chhardwari, proudly preserving the saga of victory of the faith over the power and strength.

The Colours of Faagun ‚Äì A Soulful Evening
My favourite ginger lemon tea and a balcony with the visuals of the brilliantly presented canvas of the sky, who would even want other entertainment. The Faagun Haveli, just like the other houses in Bundelkhand, looks soothing white and the extreme silence in and around it, really rejuvenates your mind that is otherwise constantly riding on the noises of varying decibel in the cities.

Ever enjoyed such sunset?
The bright evening and the leisure time void of any tension and entertainment made me look at nature‚Äôs activities that usually go unnoticed. The birds preparing for the falling night, the trees turning extremely still with the exceptions of a few movements created by the birds finding shelter on their branches and the woodpeckers still busy in pecking after their day-long flights; it seriously seems to be unrealistic for the city-dwellers for whom the streetlights and heavy traffic notifies the arrival of the night.

The month of ‚ÄòFaagun‚Äô brings along the colours of different festivities enjoyed during that time, and here I was, sitting in my balcony watching all such soulful activities of nature that seemed to be painting the white building of Faagun Haveli with their lively colours.

If you ever plan to come to Orchha and stay at Faagun Haveli, do remember to enjoy the sunset from its terrace.

As the show ended and the curtain of the night fell over the stage of the earth, I went down in the courtyard enjoying the pungent aroma of my ‚ÄòBaigan Bhartha‚Äô that I was dying to eat. And the night passed by in tranquility around the warmth of the bonfire.

I hardly expected any dreams that night, as the day itself was a series of dreams in a Bundeli Village. `

    description:`While devouring the inordinate tranquility in the Buddhist Town of Shravasti, a Srilankan coupled created enough excitement for me to visit Lumbini. I was just a few kilometers away from Nepal border and had no plan of crossing it.  But the destiny had different plans. The only train moving to Gorakhpur from Shravasti was delayed by 5 hours and there was no chance I could reach Kushinagar before midnight.

And thus was born an impromptu plan to visit Nepal.  Considering that I had no internationally valid ID proof, I was a bit skeptical about the entry. After reaching Nautanwa, I took an auto to reach the border and realised that it wasn‚Äôt really a border but looked more like a busy crossroad near Bhindi Bazaar in Mumbai.

Nobody even would have cared if I had entered without asking or informing anybody. The security process on India-Nepal border is just for namesake and nobody cares where you are going and for what purpose. Being a first-timer, I was under the impression that I need to produce some permit stating that I was allowed to enter as an Indian.

On enquiring for the registration office I was directed to a tiny room with three officers in it. They asked for ID proof and I procured my Aadhar Card, Driving License  and PAN card, none of which proved my nationality as per them.  So, your most important document doesn‚Äôt hold any value at the border. They made me read the newspaper articles (seriously? no official orders? ) stating Aadhar card is completely invalid as an identity proof at the borders.  I had to show my personal visiting card and prove my identity as a blogger to convince them (They trusted my personal visiting card but didn‚Äôt care about the official govt ID proofs I had! Sigh). After making me wait for around 10 minutes they asked me to proceed!  And I had no proof that I had a permit to cross the border.

An important lesson learnt is, head straight to Nepal considering it your own country and keep a VoterID Card and passport with you.

On the other side of the gate, a bus driver was already shouting and inviting the people going to Bhairhawa. It being the only gateway to Lumbini I had to board the bus which looked normal while entering, later did I realise that it would be stuffed with people till we don‚Äôt have any space to breathe.

The ladies sitting around me looked quite comfortable despite the over-packed bus, they were talking, laughing and were asking something to me in between, to which I only had a smile to answer.

The moment they realised that I only knew Hindi, they were more elated. They started advising me, guiding about how much I need to pay the conductor in Indian rupee. She also made it sure that the conductor returned me exact amount in Nepali Rupee. They assured how everyone would be helpful in Nepal. While getting down they also instructed other to guide me safely after Bhairhawa.

All irritation, tiredness and frustration had vanished by then. Nepal seemed to be a land of Samaritans. The belief was just reassured when a hotel person dropped me all the way to Mahabodhi temple when I didn‚Äôt prefer staying at the hotel he suggested. He refused to take even a rupee and said that helping a guest in need was his duty.

Lumbini turned out to be an enchanting place projecting the principles of Buddhism through its temples, meditation halls and kind citizens. The next night I proceeded to Kathmandu by an overnight bus, saving a night stay‚Äôs cost.

The bumpy ride didn‚Äôt let me sleep throughout the night but got me a cool friend in a fellow traveler from France. The next day in Kathmandu, we got fresh at her hostel and left to venture around on a moped and could cover most of the places in and around Kathmandu just in a day. And that makes another crazy story in of my random trip to Nepal. The same night I had to go through another bumpy ride, but this time I straightway reached the border.

Tips:

If you are an Indian, put your phone off before reaching the border, as some service provider might play a trick and levy international roaming charge even before you enter the country.
The best way to reach Nepal from India is to take a train till Gorakhpur and from there either take a bus to sonauli or take a shared taxi for 300 INR. (I could bargain the price to 150 on my return journey from Sonauli to Gorakhpur) .
Daily direct buses also ply from Varanasi to Sonauli and even to Kathmandu.
Direct buses to Kathmandu are available from Sonauli and Bhairhawa.
Bhairhawa has an airport too, so if you plan not to opt for 14 hours of tiring bus ride flight to and fro Kathmandu is also an option.
Roadways are the only ways to move around in Nepal.
You can rent a moped in almost all the tourist place in Nepal. And do carry your passport as you might not be given the vehicle without submitting your passport.
No honking in Kathmandu. It is ‚ÄòHorn Not Ok Please‚Äô place and thus you must follow the sensible law.
Please check the brakes of your vehicle beforehand because not even the capital city of Kathmandu has good roads.
Apart from mopeds Limousine like huge vans run to move around within the city area. They charge 5-10-15 NR depending upon the distance.
Small buses with numbers also ply within the city, you just need to ask the people around, which bus would go to which place.
You can cover Kathmandu, Patan and Bhratpur in a day if you set early.
Though there is entry fee at each place in Nepal, some can be barged through.
Daal Bhat and chowmin are the best and cheapest food options.`
