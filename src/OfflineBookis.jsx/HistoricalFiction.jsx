    description:`"Come closer, Emma, Aggie!" Mamas voice quivered, the rise and fall of her chest her only movements. Leaning down to her ear, she whispered to us, "Look inside the dresser. Those women needed my help. I was their Angel." Taking a shaky breath, Mama lay still.

The attending nurse entered then and motioned my sister and me away.

"What did she mean?" Agatha was just as confused as I. What dresser? Angel?" Shaking my head, we waited outside the sickroom.

"She's sleeping peacefully. You may see her." Kissing our mother goodnight, we promised to see her tomorrow.

"Sorry, dears. Your mother passed away in her sleep. When the coroner's finished, you may say goodbye." The nurse's words were kindly meant, but they didn't soften our grief. Clutching each other, we sank down on mother's sofa. Words weren't necessary as we sobbed.

The following weeks passed in a blur—calling friends, arranging, then attending Mama's funeral. At home, surrounded by friends, we shared memories. "Remember when we turned in each other's homework? Mama was so mad when our teachers told her." Being twins, we could be mischivious to people that way. "Aggie, remember that time we changed our clothes in the cloakroom? When we got home, Mama wanted to know why you were wearing my clothes!" I laughed.

"I always preferred your clothes, Emma. Mama always sewed pretty flowers on your dresses." She'd always called us her Special Angels.

"You kids had fun." Sally, our neighbor smiled sadly, "What will you do with her house?" We supposed we'd sell but weren't sure.

Afterward, we remembered her dying words. Rummaging through the dresser, we found all sorts of rubbish—ribbons, photos of her and Papa on their wedding day, and the box. It contained several diaries carefully wrapped in paper as if to preserve their secrets. We were about to discover how secretive they were.

Opening the first one, with its cracked spine, Agatha and I read the first entry in Mama’s familiar handwriting.

****** January 1, 1880 *******

The wind was roaring today; leaving my snug house, I was instantly clutched in winter's icy fingers. Bundled against the chill, I was doing the marketing, when I had a strange encounter. Passing the baker's, I met a beggar with an unusual request. "Please ma'am, do you want this child?" A voice asked, tugging my sleeve. Turning, I spied a thin slip of a woman with rather long, straggly hair, bare feet, dressed in rags. Carrying a bundle, she looked about eighteen, with the saddest eyes I've ever seen. The bundle was motionless, black eyes peeped out above the tatters the child was wrapped in. They looked about frozen, with fresh snow falling around us.

"What?" I asked, staring at her. Shuffling aside to avoid a passing carriage, she reached a not so crowded doorway, me close behind. As she explained it, she was unmarried, and unable to provide for the child. "Would you know of someone? She's three weeks old. No name yet." She looked desperate, like she wouldn't take no for an answer.

I assured her that yes, I knew of a couple who wanted a child. A lie, but the helpless miserable creature didn't know that. Getting rid of her brat was this woman's only concern. Immensely relieved, she thrust the bundle into my arms, snatched the money I offered her, and melted into the crowd, pushed along by the forceful wind.

Walking through the bustling streets with my unexpected possession, I wondered what my husband Henry, and I should do. I'm a seamstress, Henry's a chemist in town.

Now here we are, with an infant asleep in a drawer lined with rags. What an idea! "You were buying food, not a baby." He joked, glancing at it. We never wanted a child. The woman didn't even give us its (or her) name.

January 6,

Henry and I spoke to our neighbor who knows of a childless couple willing to take our orphan. For a small fee, of course.


February 1,

Have been housebound for weeks! Have another orphan in our care, a boy this time. Winter must be a good birthing season. All those hapless mothers, desperate for a solution to their mistakes.

Finding homes is easier than I realized, what with advertisements in newspapers and word of mouth. Couples are willing to pay anything for a child, never mind the circumstances of its birth. Not long after it's gone, another one quickly takes its place. Who knew you could make a living selling other people's whining brats? Nice to have extra income.

One thing I despise about children is their stench! Diapers aren't easy to sew or keep supplied. Lucky they never fuss, Henry sees to that with his special medicine. Which makes it an uncomplicated job.


March 2,

Warmer weather, at last! Flowers are blooming, sun is shining, what can be better? With so many children, Henry and I are housing them in our smaller outbuilding. Fitted with shelf-like beds, they're cozy enough. It's also my sewing area, so is perfectly explained if inquiries are made. We take it in turns, someone's always on hand to tend to their needs. Some are poorly, so separation from us is best for the present. Must be last winter's chill.

Caring for ten children is exhausting, especially this pair of twin girls! Why that mother came to us, I don't know. She paid twice my usual fee and seemed glad to be rid of them. Pretty tykes, with a dimple on each cheek, and black hair. Placing them won't be easy, Emma and I stared at one another. Us? Are we the placed-out babies? Why weren't we sold?


April 9

One of the boys died last night. I must remind Henry not to overdose their medicine. Oh well, more will come.

I've discovered girls are easier to place than boys, anyway. Except that pair of twins, must be twice the trouble and responsibility. I've taken a fancy to them myself. They're growing so fast, one is rolling over.

Because of our need for secrecy, we're careful our location isn't revealed to anyone. Babies are handed to us on street corners, in their mother's pitiful homes, or anywhere else the mother thinks is suitable. When adoptive parents are selected, we clean the children, and take them to a prearranged spot where they can be viewed. We have no control about who takes them or where they'll end up; I'm just glad when each one is off my hands.

Agatha and I head to our rooms in shocked silence. That explained a lot, I thought. The way Mama and Papa weren't always together, sometimes sneaking out at night when they thought we were asleep. How could we not have known? How many babies were sold at our house? What about our birth mother? Was she aware we weren't sold? Is she alive?

The next day, we comb through Mama's other diaries, hoping to find some record of our or any other birth parents. Instead, we stumble across something truly shocking:


August 20

Stuffy in the sewing building all day. Tending to be screaming infants was about to do my head in. Pouring the last drop of sleeping draught into their milk, I stirred vigorously, waiting for peace. As they drank, I breathed a sigh of relief.

After ironing our Sunday clothes, I checked on my angels. I've decided to separate them from the unwanted ones; they sleep with us now. They were babbling, as they should be. So pretty, with their curly hair and sweet smiles. I'd just removed some freshly baked bread out of the oven, when a cry sounded.

"No. What's going on?" Racing across the yard, I entered the babies' house. Lying on his bunk is the worst boy imaginable—Albert. Red in the face, he was wailing with all his might. No one wants a crippled child, anyway. Grabbing the nearest thing, I pressed firmly down, until his screams were smothered by the pillow. I put him out of his misery.

Night

"How's the brats?" Henry asked at supper.

"Fine." I answered, "Resting peacefully as usual." I was surprised how casual I appeared.

"And Emma and Agatha?" He asked, a twinkle in his eyes.

"Adorable. Nearly crawling."

"Precious!" He murmured fondly.

Numb, we remain on Mama's sofa, horrific diary closed. Tears in our eyes, we can't process Mama's actions. Murder? Why? Aggie spoke the unthinkable aloud, "Could there be more?"

Reporting the truth was risky in many respects. Would anyone believe us? All we had for evidence was diaries written years ago, not exactly credible. Aggie suggested we give the police her diaries, then wait to see how they handle it.

"Ladies, these diaries are intriguing. If what you say is true, then your mother indeed murdered that child. Do you know the exact location of the body?" Detective Smith looked at us from where he sat behind his desk. At least, he was listening. Shaking our heads, we prepared ourselves for a quick dismissal. "Just beneath a tree!" I replied.

"Well, I'll get back to you. We may have to dig up your yard."

So it was that on a cool morning in May, before the sun rose, uniformed men arrived with their tools to begin the horrible process. We explained where we assumed the first child was buried, but it was anyone's guess as to the others.

All through the hot morning into midday they toiled, digging, then meticulously sifting through the piles again, not wanting to miss anything. They had some success. The first child was discovered beneath a tree, the second in a flower bed, among the roses.

It was disheartening to watch their little bodies recovered out of the ground, not even wrapped up against the elements. Only bones remained. What kind of mother would do this to a child? Detective Smith fumed, dusting dirt off his hands. How is it her daughters weren't involved?

Over the weeks that followed, Detective Smith interviewed us repeatedly. "How were you kept in the dark?" He asked. We explained how growing up, Mama had said her sewing building was off-limits; it was used for business. She'd been a seamstress, or so we'd assumed judging by all the beautiful quilts she'd sold.

"We were curious why our parents sneaked out whenever we were sleeping. We'd spied on them one night." I added.

"When we'd asked, Papa said something about wild animals." Which was mostly true. We'd spotted fox and deer in some nearby woods, but nothing too threatening.

"So, you never saw the babies? Growing up, they just disappeared." Detective Smith scribbled something as Emma shook her head emphatically.

"We never even heard a cry. With them drugged, it makes sense." She lowered her pensive gaze.

We described our idyllic childhood—picnics, school (Mama and Papa attended every spelling bee and end-of-year ceremony.) Ironically, there was church, baptisms, youth group parties. Mama often referred to us as "My sweet angels sent by God. Our little miracles." How unfair and cruel it seems, our parents poking fun at other people's expense.

"Is there a way to track down their parents?" I inquired. "Not exactly. Without initials or names, it might be impossible. Many babies were born to unwed mothers, then placed out. Your parents aren't the first to run a Baby Farm."

Seeing our bewildered faces, Smith grimly clarified the unfamiliar term. There were many such operations around the country. "People assure parents homes will be provided for their children, then they sell, or in your instance, murder them."

"Like property." Emma said, disgusted, "To think, we were part of it."

"If your mother were alive today, she would most certainly go to prison." Smith declared stone-faced. Dismayed, we read newspaper-splashed headlines such as "Murderous parents." and "Children raised by Baby Farmer." Neighbors weren't speaking to us, shopkeepers refused to serve us.

We decided to turn our horrible discovery into something positive. We tried to track down some mothers, including our own. Like Detective Smith predicted, the task proved nearly impossible. "Sorry, can't help without a name." The hospital nurse said briskly. She verified there had been twins born in 1880, not with our names. "Without a name, I can't find baptism or marriage records." The priest informed us sympathetically.

Placing an advertisement of our own in our paper, we waited. It simply asked for anyone who'd given a baby up to our mother to contact us. "Would you? After reading that?" Emma asked, jabbing a finger at yet another headline. Indeed, many letters arrived after those children's bodies were discovered. One read: "Your mother is where she belongs. How couldn't you have known what your parents were doing? They profited off other people's misery! Innocent blood is on your hands."

Upset but unsurprised, we tried ignoring those letters; instead focusing on the positive. Many people praised us for revealing the truth, and for attempting to track down lost families.

"We need to talk." Detective Smith had arrived shortly after breakfast a few days after we'd placed our advertisement. "Have you seen this diary entry?" Opening one, he turned to a marked page:


September 8,

What a riduculous affair! Agatha and Emma's wretch of a mother's just turned up, demanding to have her children back. I put her in her place quickly, sending her packing with some money for her trouble. She believes her children are dead. That ought to shut her up.

"Come here, angels." They crawled to Henry and I, smiling. Picking them up, we fussed over them, playing a clapping game. "That woman won't bother us any more, pets. I promise. You're safe with us."

Hot with anger, we digested this latest revelation. How dare she? How could she stoop so low? Then again, she and Papa did commit murder! Beside me, Emma's face was white, eyes round. A range of emotions flickered across her face—sadness, revulsion, horror.

"Any luck locating your mother?" Detective Smith must be familiar with our search.

"No, no one's come forward." Emma answered.

"Aggie, look. An answer!" Emma's excited voice broke into my thoughts a couple days later. "Read this."

Dear Aggie and Emma,

My name is Doris, I was one of your mother's orphans. I was fortunate to have been placed with loving parents, and received an education. While I appreciate your pain in not knowing your birth mother, it's best to let the past rest. It'll lead to disappointment if you search further. Also, do not contact me again. Your mother (if you can call her that), did more harm than good.

Many such letters followed, with people expressing sympathy, but discouraging us from pursuing the matter. We were now being called "Farmer's Children."

Undaunted, we wrote to as many hospitals as possible, requesting any records of twins born in 1880. Nothing materialized, until an anonymous letter arrived with this message:


Dear Farmer's children,

I read your advertisement and have unpleasant news. Your mother died shortly after giving you away to that woman. She believed suicide was her only option. I don't know the circumstances, only she confided to me she couldn't live in this dark, cruel world any longer. The police discovered her in the river.

Through our tears, Emma and I sat motionless. Suicide? Had Mother kept that from us as well?

"Aggie, we must do something." Emma paused halfway through mopping the floor, "We can't allow our parents' actions to ruin those people's lives? I know an apology won't bring their babies back, but we can at least help."

"How? Something for the families?" She nodded, determined. I'd been pondering our dilemma, too. "Would anybody help us?"

"There's only one way to find out. We can advertise again." She said.


Epilogue

On a bright September afternoon, a group of mourners gathered in the cemetery. Emma and I, together with some of the families of the murdered children, stood at a small memorial. No grave, just a stone bearing the inscription: "Rest In Peace. You were much loved." One by one, gifts were placed at the base of the marker—flowers”`

    description:`With the mission running long and no exfil in sight, there’s little for Valerian and Roman to do besides purchase too many groceries, hole up in the safehouse, and settle old bets.

Val stands over the cracked electric stove, carefully stirring a pot of ukha. The delicate scent of herbs, spices, and freshwater fish spirals off the surface of the broth. It smells of home, and Val knows without looking that Roman is sprawled on the couch behind him.

“Just be careful not to let the salmon overcook,” Roman calls out. What would be genuine advice from anyone else, Val knows is actually a gentle rib.

He scoffs, though he doesn’t take his eyes off the pot. “I’ll win this time. You’ll see.”

“Sure,” Roman says generously. “Except you’re still missing something.”

Val inhales, letting the well-rounded scent settle around him. “You can bullshit about your ‘secret ingredient’ all you like—I know when you’re bluffing.”

Roman is grinning; Val can hear it in his tone. “Your gambling money in my pocket says otherwise. Fish about done?”

Delicately poking at one cube of salmon, Val is pleased to find it flaky, tender, and cooked all the way through. “Yeah. Come get it while it’s hot.”

He nudges the pot off the heat and dishes out two bowls. Roman plucks one from his hands and takes a preliminary sip.

“Hmm. You’re definitely close. But not quite. Still missing that all-important piece to bring it together.”

Val eats a spoonful as well, deflating as he realizes the truth. Roman is right. It’s good soup—but not as good as Roman’s. The flavors that had seemed so balanced in theory are lacking something crucial. His head dips with weary resignation. “Fine...you win. What’s the secret?”

“Not sure I should be telling just anyone,” Roman says in his loftiest tone. “How about this: a secret for a secret. You answer my question, and I’ll tell you what you’re missing.”

Val laughs and shakes his head, grinning down at his imperfect soup. “Fine, fine. Ask away.”

He turns to face Roman, and the dream becomes a nightmare.

The safehouse is broken and charred. Darkness seeps from the corners, a viscous black liquid that gathers higher and higher on the floor. And Roman—

Roman is in uniform, drenched in blood. Valerian knows it isn’t his own. Those bright eyes bore into Valerian’s, feverish, and when Roman speaks, more darkness oozes from between his teeth.

“Why didn’t you stop me, Val?”

Val jolts awake, nearly falling from his bunk as he flails against his sheets. His eyes take in details with trained expedience—rough white walls, a footlocker, a window looking out over the grey tinge of pre-morning light.

Val’s head falls against the pillow with a groan. He knows he won’t be getting back to sleep.

* * *
“Valerian.”

Val sights down his scope, not bothering to hide his scowl. “I’m busy.”

“It’s about Roman.”

Val feels his muscles tense, though the reticle over his target doesn’t so much as twitch. “What do I have to say to make you understand? I don’t need leave, I don’t need another psych eval, and I sure as hell don’t need your pity. Bastard got what was coming to him.”

Behind him, Lena crosses her arms. Val can’t see her, but he knows the sound.

“Lie to yourself all you like, but don’t you dare start lying to me.”

Valerian takes his eye off the scope to turn his head, looking up and over his shoulder at where Lena stands. Arms crossed, hips canted, exactly as he’d pictured her. “Did you come out just to bother me, or are you going to do anything useful to the Front?” he snaps. 

Lena rolls her eyes and takes out a scouter. “Wind from 31 degrees northeast. Target at 1572.8 meters out.”

Val presses his eye back to the scope of the long, lean Sovereign rifle, breathing out the frustration lingering in his muscles. The reticle settles perfectly in place, and the trigger pulls smooth as silk.

The air splits with the thunder of the Sovereign’s discharge, and Val feels the weapon kick hard against his shoulder. He doesn’t bother to check whether the shot landed as he sits up and glances back at Lena.

Her scouter is still held over her eyes, though she lowers it as Val turns toward her. “You always were the best,” she says with a touch of wryness. “Now, would you please listen?”

Val scoffs and slings the Sovereign over his shoulder. He gets to his feet, dusting some of the dirt and grit from the front of his uniform. “It’s cute when you imply I have a choice.”

Their boots crunch over rain-parched earth as they start the trek back to base. Valerian shields his eyes against the bloody sunset, content to let his brisk pace speak to his disinterest in what Lena has to say. Still, he doesn’t try to stop her when she brings up Roman again.

“The brass finally made their ruling,” she starts. Her voice is shaped cautiously, neither accusing nor exonerating. “The cave-in was officially labeled an accident. You’re off the hook, not that there ever was much doubt. Honestly, after everything Roman did, I’m a little surprised they never offered you a medal.”

Val’s pace doesn’t falter, but he can tell Lena sees the tension in his shoulders when she softens her voice.

“I don’t want to dredge it all up again; believe me, I don’t. But I thought you should know, there have been...troubling reports, from Old England. Someone who looks like him. Out in the forests.”

This time Valerian does pause. He whips around to search Lena’s face, even though he knows she’d never lie to him (or at least, never lie about Roman). “What are you saying? That he survived? I dropped fifty tons of rock on him, Lena.”

Lena spreads her hands in a gesture devoid of certainty. “They’re not substantiated claims. Just rumors. But you and I both know how potent his genmod was. A healing factor like that...”

The blistering heat of the desert fades from Val’s perception. For just a moment, he’s back in the chill of Old England’s forests, the thunder of falling stone still ringing in his ears. He’d cried, after. Sobbed like a baby, for the man Roman was and the thing he became and all the senseless loss of life he’d caused. Long after the tears ran dry, Val had stayed by the cave, too numb to leave and too scared to sift through the debris.

He feels the exact same, now. Terrified to dig further, not even knowing which alternative he’s scared of.

Eventually, he turns back towards base. He needs, suddenly and unequivocally, to sleep. A long, quiet nap curled up in his bunk sounds like exactly the thing.

“Will you go?” Lena calls after him. “Back to Old England?”

Val shakes his head without looking back. “They’d never assign me there.”

“Didn’t stop you the first time, as I recall.”

Val pretends not to hear her.

* * *
He dreams about Roman again, of course. It’s always been Roman.

Before the disastrous Operation: Crimson Thread, it was Roman’s laugh, his crooked smile, his dancing eyes. That unshakeable confidence. Arrogance, some would say. Roman’s genmod, the genetic alteration that allowed him to heal so rapidly and cleanly, was a powerful one, and he treated it like immortality. His attitude was infectious, intoxicating. Everything about the man lit Val like a fuse.

After Crimson Thread, Roman changed. His fire became feverish, secretive. He smiled less, isolated more, trained harder. He pushed his friends away. He pushed Val away.

Val fooled himself into thinking it was a temporary change, a grief response. Maybe Lena did, too. No one could have truly anticipated what Roman became.

There’s a new age dawning, Val. Can you hear the cries?

Val couldn’t. Not back then. But every night since, he’s heard them: the wails of friends, family, innocents—every life cut short by Roman’s hands, until the chorus of the damned numbers hundreds strong, every last one of them screaming inside Val’s head.

Why didn’t you stop him, Val?

* * *
Old England is cold, damp, and crawling with hostile mutations. Some are intelligent enough to form loose bands or packs; others eat each other on sight. Valerian hates the whole island with a passion.

He starts his investigation at the Lodge—one of the few bastions of sanity on this rock. It’s large as frontier settlements go, with a population somewhere in the triple digits. It also happens to host a small base for the Front, but the other Frontsmen turn out to be of little help. None of them have seen this supposed specter of Roman.

“If we did, we’d put him back in the ground, eh?” The Captain smirks. “Wish I’d been there to kill the bastard myself, but apparently some off-duty sergeant got the honors. Happened here, you know, just 20 klicks to the west.”

Valerian knows.

“Look, kid, I’ll level with you,” another officer tells him. “The locals like to report a sighting now and then, just to keep the Front’s interest. This place wouldn’t last a week without our patrols.”

“Roman Tovhana?” This soldier just shakes his head with a grin. “You’re about four months too late, my friend. Better luck next time.”

The townspeople are hardly more forthcoming. Most of them scowl and spit at Roman’s name. Some of them recall hearing a rumor about the man haunting the site of his death, but no one can remember who reported such a thing.

Val was hoping it wouldn’t come to this. But like the genmod that keeps his hands rock-steady on his weapons, he isn’t easily shaken. With a pack of supplies, his sidearm, and plenty of ammo, he heads out west towards the last place he saw Roman alive.

It takes him almost three days of unrelenting rain to find the cave again. When he does, it’s because he nearly trips over the entryway.

Loose stone shifts and skitters beneath his boots as he stumbles back. Squinting through the downpour, he can just make out the shadowy mouth of the cave behind its shroud of overgrown vegetation.

He approaches cautiously, taking in details. Trampled grass and underbrush. Small, muddy puddles about the right shape for bootprints. Someone’s been here, and recently. Maybe several someones.

That’s when he hears it, a muted echo of a voice he never thought he’d hear again.

“No! No, please, just let me go—”

Val’s lungs lock down. Like getting the wind knocked out of him in training, he can’t seem to find his breath.

Roman.

But Roman has never sounded like this. He never begged, not even staring down the barrel of a gun.

((Knew you’d be the one to find me.))

Val takes a step forward. Another. He stumbles down the uneven, natural steps of the cave, reeling as the smell of damp earth and rotting leaves brings back the memory, as clear as the rain on his skin.

((Roman’s smile. His easy posture. Val could almost convince himself, could almost believe this was his Roman, risen from the depths of madness.))

He falls against the slick stone wall of the cave, drinking deep gulps of air. He has rain in his eyes.

((But Roman’s eyes...his eyes were alight, gleaming in the beam of Val’s flashlight. Feverish.))

A new voice echoes from floor to ceiling. Laughing. “Still haven’t figured it out, have you?”

“No, wait—PLEASE!”

Roman’s scream shakes Val back to reality. That he recognizes, from a hundred reckless missions. From a terrible, thunderous rockslide.

Val’s steps quicken as he scrambles over fallen stone. Someone, he registers distantly, must have shifted enough of the wreckage to make a path.

He plunges deeper into the cave, Roman’s scream still lingering in his ears like the cutting edge of a knife. Finally, Val sees the flicker of light up ahead.

Nothing, not a single one of his fears (hopes?) prepares him for what he finds.

Roman Tovhana is alive. There’s no mistaking that proud nose, those dark eyes, the scar through his upper lip. And there’s certainly no mistaking the desperate, thrashing motions of something clawing for safety, for life.

Two strangers, a man and a woman, hold him down on his back. The man sits astride him, pinning his legs. In one hand he bears a bloody knife. Roman's clothes—long ago, a uniform—are weathered and torn, displaying the fresh, oozing wound down his chest and stomach.

“That one’s for my sister,” the man with the knife says. “This one’s for my wife—”

Valerian’s sidearm is in his hands before he’s fully pieced things together. As Roman screams again, Val levels the gun.

“Put the knife down.”

Three pairs of eyes snap towards him.

“And who the hell are you?” the woman barks.

Val’s never been so glad for his genmod, never been so fervently thankful that his gun remains steady, regardless of the storm lashing against his insides. “I’m with the Adamant Front. Care to explain what the hell you’re doing here?”

With Val serving as a distraction, Roman thrashes again, almost slipping free before the man with the knife snarls and jams the blade into Roman’s gut.

For once in his life, Val doesn’t hesitate.

The shot rings out over and over, echoing down the tunnel with the force of a cannon blast. The man formerly holding the knife howls in pain as the blade and two of his fingers spin away into darkness.

“Next one goes between your eyes,” Val hisses. “Get up. Both of you. Walk away, and never come back.”

“You bastard,” the nameless man gasps. He’s clutching the bloody remains of his right hand, trembling. “You crazy son of a— Don’t you know who this is?”

“I gave you a fucking order.” His voice doesn’t waver, even with doubt screaming in his ear like a hundred damned souls—

He doesn’t know if he’s prepared to kill these people. He doesn’t know if he could bring himself to cross that line—especially with the scenes of Roman’s murders so vivid in his mind.

Fortunately, his resolve isn’t put to the test. The man and the woman scramble upright and flee, hurrying past Val towards the mouth of the cave. Their footsteps have barely begun to fade when Val holsters his side arm and crouches down at Roman’s side.

This close, he can see the man’s a wreck. Hazy brown eyes squint up at him from a face sunken with hunger and creased from sleepless nights. His body is all angles, his torn clothing now drenched in blood.

“Hey,” Val says, and his voice comes out softer than he intends. “I need you to stay with me. There’s— I have so many questions.”

Roman’s eyes focus slowly, still narrow with pain and confusion. But clear. Lucid.

“Wh-who...who are you?”

* * *
“Here. Eat it while it’s hot.”

Val slides a bowl of ukha across the table, then settles in the other chair with his own. The delicate, complex aroma reminds him of home.

The man once named Roman Tovhana picks up his spoon and digs in. His eagerness to eat anything he doesn’t have to hunt and kill himself hasn’t waned, despite the month he’s spent in the safety of this rickety apartment.

He calls himself Rowan now, after the badly dented name he’d found on the dog tags he woke up with. It’s taken some getting used to, but Val rarely slips up. Rowan is very different from the man he once knew.

Instead of the military buzz of his predecessor, Rowan’s dark hair is long enough to flop in his eyes. He has dozens of new scars, most of which are twisted, knotted things or else deep gouges that never completely filled back in. And, of course, he no longer wears a uniform.

Neither does Valerian. The brass hadn’t known what to do with either of them, and so Val found himself quietly shuffled out of the fold. He misses it, some days—the hard work, the adrenaline, the camaraderie. But he doesn’t linger on the things he’s lost, not when the pieces he does have need so much work. Lena has been after him to try an old world remedy called therapy, which, from what Val can gather, involves a lot of talking and a lot of patience. Well, at least he’s good at one of those.

“This is amazing.” Rowan’s quiet voice breaks through Val’s reverie.

He looks up to see Rowan smiling—no longer a rare sight, but still just as valuable. Valerian smiles back and eats another spoonful. “It’s called ukha. I’m glad you like it. Took me years to get the recipe right, and it was never as good as Roman’s.” His smile fades. “I suppose I’m still missing something.”

Rowan considers for a moment. He takes a slow, exploratory sip. “...Huh. Have you tried a splash of—what’s the stuff called, from Lena—”

“Vodka?” A tiny thrill runs through Val’s stomach as he considers. “Hold on.”

He returns with a half-full bottle. A dash for his bowl, and one for Rowan’s. Val finds himself oddly nervous as he stirs the broth and raises a spoonful to his lips.

The vodka does complement well. It’s exactly what Val’s recipe was lacking—yet it still tastes nothing like Roman’s.

“I think it’s perfect,” Rowan declares. “Seriously, Val, you should write this down.”

Val eats another spoonful, savoring and analyzing. It is perfect. Distinct from Roman’s, but just as good.

Rowan brushes his long hair from his face and happily polishes off his bowl. Val watches him eat with an old, complicated twist in his heart. There will always be a part of him that longs for answers he’ll never receive. But he does know three things.

I loved him. I killed him. I saved him.

His dreams are quiet tonight.`

    description:`You would never have noticed it if you weren’t looking for it. That was precisely the point.


The instructions given in my embroidery group had been clear enough: After nightfall, take a stroll on the second lane past the bakery, look for the unlit lamppost and turn down that dark alley, they said in hushed voices, as the pianist began playing in sudden loud fervor, by coincidence. Then you will see a mossy stone staircase, which you will descend, and at the end of it there is a dim hallway. She lives through the set of green doors on the left.


The doors are tall and French like my husband’s mistress, but peeling and weathered. I can tell they were once painted a lovely shade of emerald green. Half of that green paint lies in small piles of flakes on the cobblestone. I debate knocking, and decide instead to reach with false confidence for the rusted copper handle. It turns downward easily. A small bell rings and echoes.


Welcome.


On the posters she is grotesque, an example of how time and sin turn a person sour, but in person she has the kind of enduring beauty you can’t tear your eyes away from.


Do come in darling, don’t be shy. Contrary to popular belief, I don’t bite. Although I can’t say nothing here does.


Her voice is like a wind chime, melodic and resonating, barely brushing over the crashing waves of her words. I wonder if I’m here too long if that voice will drag me out to deep sea. Or did that only work on men in the myths?


Take a seat, love. Yes, there is perfect. Would you like a cup of tea? Well, it’s never too late for tea, is it now? I enjoy it late into the night myself, but maybe you’ve been raised more proper than that. Here.


The cup is warm, not hot. If she noticed my shaking hands when reaching for it she didn’t say a word. It takes more than a few seconds for my eyes to adjust to the warmly lit room after a dark and shadowy street.


Among her many talents, it cannot be said that she was a good decorator. The shabby boards of the walls are empty but for an assortment of faded newspaper clippings from the highlights of her anonymous career. Obituaries, mostly. A tattered blue curtain with tassels hangs behind the armchair she’s perched in, dividing off part of the room. Eccentrically painted shelves house arrays of books and bottles of objects my gaze prefers not to settle on. She would have been called a witch for her collections had she not already acquired numerous more colorful nicknames by the public. The only item of some value is worn loosely around her slender wrist - a heavy and ornate gold watch. The kind of thing that would make a petty thief's day to see glinting underneath a man's sleeve in the street. She catches me admiring it and smiles thinly, holding up her arm up to eye-level.


Isn’t it a beauty? It was my first husband's, this watch. On the tenth anniversary of his death, I’m going to smash it to bits and melt the gold into a necklace for myself. I deserve a little gift from him, I think.


Her laugh unnerves me, but I find myself too curious to be afraid. I politely say my condolences for her husband’s death.


Oh darling, don’t be sorry that that man is dead. The one good thing he did was to be the inspiration for the charity work I do. I haven’t always done this. I used to be an actress, you know, a leading lady of the stage. Men would come from all over the city to see my shows, for I was beautiful then. Sometimes after the shows they would approach me, usually blind drunk, complimenting my dress or what was underneath it, asking for a kiss or a drink or a night. And sometimes they didn’t ask. My husband became my husband not because he asked but because he damaged me, and he was rich enough to get away with it and clever enough to know that marriage was my only option.


She smooths down the skirt of her maroon dress, then looks up at me with a solemn expression I can’t fully read. It isn’t hard to believe she was once a sought-after woman. Though sunken in age, her cheeks are smooth and her face looks as though it was hand-carved out of porcelain by God. Her hair is twisted into a dark crown atop her head, secured with metallic pins. Her eyes are like a cat’s, but not a house cat, no, definitely not. Like those of a tiger that has been left to go hungry for far too long. I will her to continue talking and not look at me with those eyes again. We sip our tea in unison, upholding our masquerade as ladies. She takes in a breath.


He said he loved me, and at the beginning I believed it. He may have loved me. He certainly desired me. I think mostly he loved seeing the desire and jealousy of other men when he told them I was his wife. But that got old fast. So did I, in his eyes. When it had been a year and I still had not given him a child, I turned ugly to him and he acted ugly accordingly.


One night, he came home from the pub talking about how the other men’s wives had filled their houses with children by now. He spoke of babies like cattle. Then he threatened that he ought to tell the whole town that I was secretly a whore and leave me. I should have kept quiet and obeyed and smothered him in his sleep, like a good wife. Instead, I promised him that as long as I was alive I would never let a child be born cursed enough to have him as a father. I’m sure you know what happens next, or otherwise you wouldn’t be here, my darling.


She traces a scar on her chin that I hadn’t noticed before, extending along her jaw to the start of the delicate bones of her neck. I imagine it snaking around the rest of her throat in a ring, strangling her pale skin, and my breath catches. It looks as if lightning struck her. She was struck, though not by something as rare as lightning.


I instinctively touch my collarbone where I know without looking there is a ghastly bruise. My modest neckline covers it, but somehow it feels like she knows it’s there, my mark of pain. I hope it goes away quickly so my husband does not think me unsightly. But then again, perhaps that will not be necessary. I nod at her meekly to show that I do know what happens next.


I can’t say whether he truly meant to kill me. But to hurt me, to wound me, to make my thoughts and words disappear in flames, he meant that with all his heart. The funny thing is it was him who made my words true. Of course, he couldn’t have known that I was with child. Even I did not know then. After, no one would ever get to know. I made a gravestone, although there was nothing to bury. And then a month later I buried my poor sick husband next to it, marked only with a slab that did not bear his name. Wealthy and beloved as his gold in his life, in death he became only stone. The disease had taken him so quickly that there was no time for anyone to save him. Shame on chance to take him from this world so young. Got him like…well, like poison, essentially.


The porcelain around her eyes cracks faintly in amusement. I have nothing to say in response, my mind stuck on the picture of a crude gravestone smaller than it should be.


Now, love. How would you like your tragedy to occur?


The widows in my town all chose differently. Most agree that the worse methods are only to be used for the worse husbands, but sometimes there is no rhyme or reason to it. After all, all’s fair in love and war. Millions of second and third and fourth thoughts crossed my mind on the way here, but now those voices are silent and there is only mine. Mine, and hers, and the input of the hissing wind outside.


Well? What will it be?


In two weeks it will happen. On the way home after a day of work, my husband will feel a bout of hopelessness that gives him a nudge to hurl himself off of the local bridge. The river below is not a kind one, especially to those who never learned to swim. He will have been drunk, since he often is and everyone knows how he gets when he’s drunk. No one will discuss a death as taboo as taking your own life. My children and I will cry and wear black for weeks, though no longer than what is expected. At the same time the black of our bruises will fade.


He won’t be missed very much, really. Perhaps that French woman will miss him, but she would have met the man that I knew soon enough. I will decide to raise my children in the countryside alone, and we will be happy. I cannot say yet whether I will regret it. The final time I will see the woman’s wild tiger's eyes, she will tell me that not once has she regretted anything in her life. She will say that it was a pleasure to do it, and fearfully I will believe her.


Oh, it really is getting late, love. Your family must be at home expecting you.


I reply that they are, and I thank her for her kindness, nervously reaching to shake her hand. How much blood has coated it? On the posters they say she has killed three men, but I know these were simply the times she wanted it enough to make it gruesome. The posters also envision her as grotesque, which means that they have not ever seen her, or the mark on her jaw from her fall after being struck by lightning. The posters know nothing. The men know nothing.


We women must stick together, yes?


The image of my young daughter appears and consumes my mind. I would do everything in my power to ensure she never has to know the instructions to get here. There will be no scars for my girl to trace, I will make sure of that.


I nod and drop the woman’s unassuming porcelain hand. Beneath the sound of her wind chime voice is a softer noise I hadn’t paid attention to before, almost like a breeze rustling through dying trees, overlaid with the humming of the Earth. It is separate from the wind and the rushing of my blood. She notices my piqued interest, and rather than say anything, stands, chuckles, and regally draws back the tattered blue curtain behind her. In view now is a cage, filled with twisting and writhing scaled bodies, hissing and competing with each other for air. They move as one, a trembling monster of green. I step back in sudden horror. She isn’t looking at me, but I see her eyes flash ravenously.


You don’t have to worry about them, darling. Their venom is reserved for the venomous.

You told this wonderful story with admirble conciseness—roughly 2,000 words, yet somehow I feel like I know each of the characters entire life stories.

I couldn't stop reading! And the twist of snakes at the end !!! I love how you compared something unassuming like the breeze to the hiss of a venomous snake. It's vividly described how I felt as the reader.

I think the way a character deals with the conflict in their path is where the technique of the author really shines through, and that was certainly true here. Wonderful job.

“tall and French like my husband’s mistress,” that’s a hell of a line.

The story about the actress’s first husband is awful. It’s ridiculous that it happens all over the world to this day. The idea that a woman is broken just because she’s been abused by a man and then that it fixes it by marrying them. He sounds like a horrifically clever man to trap her like that.

I half wish there were witches like this in the world. Too many move from abuse to abuse without facing any form of justice. This is revenge I know but for the woman it must be...

I agree, and I’m glad the culture is a lot better than the past and victims can find help and support, but it’s sickening to think about how it does happen to so many people :(

Really beautiful. I love your style so much, and I can't wait to read more. I loved the lines: "She was struck, though not by something as rare as lightning" and "I would do everything in my power to ensure she never has to know the instructions to get here." Thank you for this powerful story.

    description:`Trojans and Achaeans alike, rejoice!


Your boy Hermes is back at it again with another edition of his weekly newsletter. I may be a messenger to the gods, but you know my heart has always been with the hot gossip of folks down below! I'm a messy messenger who lives for drama, after all.


Ever since the Aphrodite-Ares-Hephaestus love triangle drama died down eons ago, the tea has been cold up on Mount Olympus. Thankfully, Goddess of Discord Eris has finally brought us the earth-shattering pettiness us gossip-mongers have been waiting for! If you've been craving drama, you must stay perched.


As you may have heard, a war has begun. Bad news for the frontlines, but a goldmine for me! Word on the street has it Helen of Sparta, long known for her elusive beauty, has ditched hot-headed husband Menelaus for the much younger, hunky Paris of Troy. Needless to say, news of the separation were poorly received by the King of Sparta. Forget about political stability and diplomacy, armies were sent all spears-blazing to avenge his wounded honour. Heck, who wouldn't the same with the luxury of a thousand soldiers, am I right? Hades hath no fury like a king scorned.


This may all sound familiar, but what you may not know is how this shocking betrayal came to be. Thankfully, your favourite messenger has some insider godly information to share.


Turns out Helen's wandering eyes had some strings pulling on them! At the center of this shocking affair, you'll find a trio of familiar divas. That's right, it all started with bickering within the unholy trinity of feuding olympians!


Let's hope Peleus and Thetis enjoyed their wedding, because the WHOLE thing is their fault! Let's just say Eris wasn't exactly pleased after her name was left off the invite list. As a result, she may have slightly overreacted (the party wasn't all that anyway, to be honest - I've seen better DJs at the Eleusinian Mysteries).


Always one to look for trouble, the Goddess of Discord dropped an apple right next to a pond where Olympus's leading ladies were bathing. The plot twist: the apple was inscribed with a message that read "to the fairest."


You can imagine this spurred quite a conflict between Athena, Aphrodite, and Hera. These three could never resolve a debate by themselves. It's expected from Aphrodite and Hera, but you'd think the Goddess of Wisdom would know better.


To settle the dispute, our leading ladies reached out to Paris for some male perspective, because what could go wrong with that? Of course, bribery was involved. Athena tried to woo him with knowledge (boring!) and Hera promised him political power. Alas, it was all to no avail. Paris being the rake that he is, he naturally chose Aphrodite's gift: the heart of the most beautiful woman in the world.


Paris, you need to think with your brain, my man! And thus, the war began. It's far from over, however, and you can be sure your most beloved messy messenger will be there to cover it all!


XOXO, Hermes


Hermes's Messy Missive

Volume XII, Issue IV


Trojans and Achaeans alike, rejoice! Hermes, your messy messenger who lives for drama, is back at it again.


First, I'd like to stress I cannot comment on the ongoing case between Peleus and I for legal reasons. I will have to leave his name and that of his wife out of this missive until his lawsuit for slander has been resolved. To avoid injecting more bad blood into this situation, I'll try to keep things short and clean this time.


Today, I deliver some short but sizzling tea from the frontlines. Agamemnon, commander of the Achaeans, has been forced by Apollo to return his captive lover Chryseis to her father. Perks of being a priest include having Apollo on your side, always.


Word has it Agamemnon has now stolen Achilles's lover, Briseis. Heartbroken, Achilles has withdrawn from battle! Another love triangle feeding Greece with thirsty whispers. This shocking turn of events leaves us wondering how the Greeks will recover from losing the support of their greatest, most revered hero. If Achilles does return to the war effort, he can at least count on his closest, dearest "companion" Patroclus. That's right, emphasis on the quotation marks. If you know, you know.


In other news, Hector has had a lot of pressure on his shoulders lately. Will he manage to cope with the burden? Careful H, you wouldn't be the first leader to crumble under pressure.


XOXO, Hermes


Hermes's Messy Missive

Volume XII, Issue V


Trojans and Achaeans, I have some difficult news to share.


I'm afraid your favourite messy messenger will have to put his column on hiatus. I have been hit with another tricky lawsuit following my completely harmless comment regarding Achilles and Patroclus. Boo, leave it to Greek soldiers to be dramatic over a whole bunch of nothing. What can I say, there is no smoke without fire... or should I say the fires of passion?


As a result, the court has ordered me to stop publishing my wildly popular column for the time being. I wouldn't want to anger the Goddess of Justice (she's a tough one), hence I must comply.


Rest assured, this is only temporary. Soon, I shall return!


XOXO, Hermes


Hermes's Messy Missive

Volume XII, Issue VI


Trojans and Achaeans, you have betrayed me.


I trusted you would remain my faithful readers through and through, even during my hiatus. It now seems another writer has taken the spotlight in my absence: some unknown poet by the name of Homer.


A pox on epic poetry! To my readership, I resent your shift towards a less deserving genre and I will leave this charlatan to relate the remaining days of the Trojan War, but I prophesize that one day, poets will fumble and gossip-monger will once again become the most prominent of writers. Verses will be forgotten, Muses will have no one to sing to, and earthly people shall once again rely on tabloids as their premium source of information. Rest assured, I will return!


Until then,


XOXO, Hermes`

    description:`Dearest darling Herbert,


What excitement we have had! 


Mother and I boarded our train on Thursday. The conductor was a charming man. I swear he held my hand for just a moment too long. The weather was terrible, of course, but we were heading for the sun, and neither of us cared one jot. Then the thunderstorm started, which terrified Mother. She shrieked like she had seen a dozen mice with every rumble and flash. It was good fortune we shared our carriage solely with a group of nuns from a silent order. Their luggage labels showed they were heading on a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. One wonders how they afforded first-class travel. Mother was distraught, but the ladies were charming and prayed for us throughout the storm. At least, I think they included us in their prayers as they constantly waved their crosses and prayer books at us. I'm sure they did not mind my cigarette smoke. They were only menthol, after all.


It was a disappointment you could not be with us. What a comfort that would have been. Such a shame you could not leave your poor Mr. Ross. If only the dear old thing had passed away when expected. Oh, how terribly callous that must sound, but you know, Herbert, our dear neighbour, is suffering so much. I wish you could ease his pain. Well, I shall say no more on that subject.


We arrived safely in Liverpool just in time for dinner at our hotel. It is a divine place. If the weather had improved, I should have joined a group of handsome young men for tennis. We met them in the hotel lounge last evening. One of them is the cousin of Ronnie Montagu. Do you remember him? The red-headed chap who flirted with me outrageously last August. I'm sure you were jealous, as you did not say a word to me all evening. Instead, I tested the water in the swimming pool this morning. I have a daring new costume! Do you like the photograph, and are you shocked by your brazen fiancee? Perhaps you will sleep with it under your pillow and dream of me. 


Earlier this afternoon, Mother and I took a walk, but several men were begging in the street! Can you believe it, darling? Why were they not at work? One of them said to Mother that he had not eaten for two days. He had the most dishevelled and unpleasant appearance, so we returned to the hotel for afternoon tea.


Tomorrow, we will board the ship at 3.00 pm. I do hope you will write soon.


Your adoring Dorothea.

Saturday 8th October 1932 - London


Dear Miss Dorothea,


Thank you for taking the time from your busy day to write to me. I am glad you and her ladyship arrived at your hotel without incident.


Mr. Ross is much improved today. Dyspepsia is a most painful condition, but I do not believe it to be fatal. While I appreciate he seems, to you, to be of advanced years, I have no reason to expect his imminent death. I would be most distressed if you thought I cared about the legacy I shall receive on his passing. I assure you; Miss Dorothea, I do not need the money. It is sad Mr. Ross does not have a family to benefit from his generosity.


The photograph you enclosed was indeed daring. I will keep it locked away as I would not wish the housekeeper to see it. She is subject to heart palpitations.


I am very grateful for your friendship Miss Dorothea, but may I politely request that you not refer to me as your fiance? Her ladyship would not approve. I am sure this is your wonderful sense of humour at play, and in time, you will find a suitable young man of your own social class.


I have heard people are starving in the streets of many of our northern cities because of the depression. Exports of coal have fallen, and the mines have closed. They report that one million men are out of work. As a result, the ports have fewer merchant ships, and the Liverpool dockyards are laying men off. I am sorry that you and her ladyship had an unpleasant encounter.


Today I am driving Mr. Ross to the House of Commons to meet Mr. Ramsey MacDonald. The Prime Minister wishes to discuss further limitations to importing foreign goods. I shall take a walk around the National Gallery while I wait.


I wish you a pleasant voyage.


Your humble servant, Herbert Morris.

Monday 10th October 1932 - RMS Lancastria, Cartagena


Darling Boy, 


I had to share the news, such excitement as I have ever known. We have had a rescue at sea! Dozens of dear little Belgian sailors surround us. Their ship sank this morning. I do loathe the Bay of Biscay. It makes one feel a little drunk, reeling from one side of the boat to the other, and poor Mother could only keep down a little turtle soup, a small portion of pheasant pie, and only one dessert! I believe the crew is sharing their rations with the Belgians. 


There has been an appeal to the passengers for donations to help the sailors, who will be ashore tomorrow morning. Mother has a fur coat that has a little blight. I am sure she will not miss it. The change to our itinerary has upset Mother very much. She is looking forward to reaching Lisbon. She has instructed our steward to fetch the captain at once.


Mother tells me that Mr. Ross is worth some £100000! I am delighted for your good fortune, my darling. We shall have great fun when we are married. When do you think that might be? I hear that Mr. Ross has a diseased heart. I am sure you take great care of his medication. It would be sad if he were to overdose accidentally. 


Write soon, my beloved. I long to hear your news.


Your adoring, Dorothea.

Friday 14th October 1932 - London


Dear Miss Dorothea


Your letter arrived 'par avion,' this morning. It was most exciting to receive the post with a Spanish stamp. The housekeeper, Miss Harris, was delighted to have the postage stamps to give to her nephew.


We heard the news of the SS Scheldestad on the radio. How tragic that some 40 sailors lost their lives. I feel a sense of great sadness for the mothers who have lost their sons and wives that will never see the return of their husbands. We in the servants' hall have donated a small sum of money that the vicar will send to the bereaved. Reverend Jones knew several Belgian refugees from his parish in Folkestone during the Great War.


It surprised me to hear that some 250000 Belgians arrived in England when the Germans invaded. How sad they lost their home to invaders, only to return home, without choice, when the war ended. The Reverend said the government wanted the jobs back for returning servicemen. Miss Harris had a niece who was a conductress on a tram. She also lost her employment, as a soldier required the job. Miss Harris believes they will one day pay men and women the same wages for the same work, but I fear that is most unlikely.


Mr. Ross met with the Prime Minister. Mr. MacDonald is a good man but in poor health, and Mr. Ross says he can not remain in power for much longer. The Tories dominate the National Government, and his Labour policies have little support. The newspapers once again reported that his son was a conscientious objector during the war. It did not reflect well upon him.


My employer is enjoying good health. The rumours of his heart's weakness are ill-informed, and he is not currently taking any medication. I would most respectfully beg you not to consider me as an object of your affection, Miss Dorothea. I believe some may have exaggerated my expectations, and I would not wish to disappoint you.

Your humble servant,


Herbert Morris.

Tuesday 18th October 1932 - Villa Santa Maria, Lisbon


Dearest Herbert,


I am so glad to hear that Mr. Ross is well. I hope he is not overdoing things with all his political work. Mother says he should not concern himself with the north when things are so bad in London. I swear we waited over half an hour for a porter to collect our bags at the station. Why are men unemployed when clearly there is a need for essential workers? But enough of political matters, I am sure I will exhaust myself with such thinking. Dolly Matthews says I worry far too much.


Mother and I were reminiscing this morning about your dear father, how he carried me on his shoulders when I was a child. It was such fun galloping around the yard pretending he was a pony. Oh, how we laughed when he lost a shoe. Happy days. He was a great valet and a staunch friend to dear Mr. Ross. It is honourable that Ross should regard you as a son and heir. I describe you this way to my dearest friends.


We are staying here until April. If Mr. Ross should succumb to the winter influenza, please join us here, my darling. I would love to write more, but Mother and I are going to a party with some film director and his chums. They smoke the most delightful Turkish cigarettes.


Until we meet again,


Your adoring Dorothea

24th October 1932 - London


Dear Miss Dorothea


Thank you for your most entertaining letter.


This morning I drove Mr. Ross to Trafalgar Square. There was a most deplorable scene when the National Hunger Marchers met with Mr. Mosley's British Union of Fascists. Mr. Ross instructed me to use the motor car to take several injured men and women to the hospital. Many of the marchers had left Glasgow in September. Their boots were little more than scraps of leather, bound with rags. Blood ran from their torn feet. They intend to address parliament about the abolition of the means test. There is much concern that government agents infiltrated the march, wishing to discredit their peaceful aims.


Here we have exciting news. On Saturday evening, Mr. Ross introduced us to Miss Ethel MacDonald. They are engaged to be married. Farley Hall may indeed yet have an heir. A band played in the garden, and Miss Harris and I danced a celebratory jig around the kitchen table. Despite the 30 years between them, I believe this is a sincere love match.  


I am sure Miss MacDonald will take excellent care of Mr. Ross' health.


It will be a pleasure to see you next April, Miss Dorothea.


Your humble servant Herbert Morris.

30th October 1932 - Villa Rossini Lisbon


Dear Mr. Morris


Alas, my one true love, you have sadly deceived me. I wish you and Miss Harris a happy future together, and of course, I release you from any obligation toward me. I was not expecting many years of happiness; you being so much older than me, Herbert, but I had hoped to be a bride before considering a lonely widowhood.


Mr. Ross, it appears, has had his head turned by a pretty ankle. Ah well, there is no fool like an old fool. And no doubt he will keep you, and the future Mrs. Morris, in service together.


Ronnie Montagu arrived in Lisbon yesterday. Mother and I are now his house guests. Dear Ronnie's father is seriously ill, and Ronnie may have to return to London soon to be at his bedside, as a most thoughtful son should. It is my duty to be there to console him.


I must ask you, Herbert, not to write to me again. I should find it too upsetting.


Your heartbroken friend, Dorothea

Dorothea and Mr. Morris are captivating characters! This was such a fun, yet thought provoking `

“Lie back, Mum and try and relax. Remember the doctor told you that getting agitated would not do you any good’ Martha gave her daughter a confused look, not really knowing who she was.


“I took him lunch, every day, every single day”.


“I know you did, Mum. I remember”.


Maggie recalled as a child her softly spoken and hardworking mother delivered her father a packed lunch every day. At the time she did not think this was strange, it was just part of their routine. She and her brother would stay with their grandmother, while her mother would make the two-mile return trip on foot, rain, hail or shine.


On reflection, it was a strange thing for her to do. In the early 1850’s Ballarat was not very safe for a woman to be making the trip along the dusty road alone. Miners from all walks of life had descended on the town looking for a change in their fortunes. It would not be unusual for men to be drunk or brawling even mid- morning. Wild dogs and snakes were also a concern. Why did she insist on doing this?



March 1852 Ballarat VIC


The morning dawned bright and welcoming as Martha walked along the track by the river to meet her husband, Paolo. Even though the married a few years earlier and were the proud parents of two young children, they still jumped at the opportunity to snatch some time together, if it presented itself. Love’s initial attraction had not waned with time.


She saw him moving around up ahead, at the usual meeting place near the bend of the river.


“Oh good” she thought. “He managed to get away”. She quickened her pace and adjusted the picnic basket as she knew that they would not have long together.


She then stopped abruptly.


The man that stepped out from behind the tree was not her husband, Paolo but his boss, Graham McPhee.


Mr McPhee was not one of life's gentlemen. He was not overly familiar with bathing, and he treated his workers with contempt. The mine he managed was one of the more successful minds in the goldfields but he forced his workers to work long days, with poor, light no breaks and the threat of physical violence. He carried a stockwhip which would not have been out of place on one of the neighbouring squattocracy cattle properties. To the shame of his workers he carried out body searches, sometimes strip searches, on their departure every day. The aim of these searches was determine if they were trying to smuggle out any nuggets of gold they may have discovered during the day. Daily searches were standard practise on the goldfields, however, Mr McPhee appeared to relish in dehumanising his workforce. It was if this act gave the small, cruel man some modicum of credibility and power and he lapped it up.


“Good morning, Mrs Watson off to see your husband, I presume.” He sneered. “Unfortunately he's been held up today, and he sent me in his place. He wanted me to taste your wares.” His gaze looked her up and down but he did not appear to have any interest in the small picnic basket in the crook of her arm.


Martha felt her fear rising at the back of her neck and stopped in her tracks. She began to think quickly as she backed.


The grimy Scotsman was quicker than her and grabbed her elbows and pinned her against the nearest gumtree.


Martha had no hope of fending off his animal needs and instinct told her that the less she struggled the quicker the ordeal would be over. She also figured that the physical impact would be reduced if she did not put up a lot of resistance.


Graham McPhee whispered in her ear” Why aren't you struggling, do you want this? I know your kind, all soft and innocent on the outside, but on the inside, secretly gagging for it.”


Martha's skin crawled, but she held her resolve. I will not give this man the satisfaction of knowing I'm scared. He is a bully and that is what bullies thrive on.


McPhee ran his hand roughly over her dress, rubbing her breasts and then grabbed her between the legs. He applied pressure there for about 30 seconds or so and then dropped his hand and took a few steps away from her.


“I’m a happily married man, and I'm not going to fall for your tricks. Just wait till I tell the lads what you were up to” and with that he turned on his heel and walked back in the direction of the mine.


Shaking Martha slumped to the ground and put her head in her hands. What just happened? She knew that she could not let Paolo know, as he was so hot headed that he would kill McPhee and that would not help the situation.


Martha was a strong capable woman, loving and soft to her kin but a worthy adversary to anyone who crossed her. Graeme McPhee now had a target on his back and she would not rest until this act was avenged. Martha just needed to work out the best way to do this.


As she walked back towards town on the river track, her heart rate returning to normal. she thought. “ I have to be logical about this and take my revenge where it is going to make the most impact”.


If she made a complaint it would only result in her not being believed and Paolo being humiliated, he may even lose his job and they needed the small amount McPhee paid his workers. The troopers of the day were very open to bribes and a complaint could backfire badly. Money is the only thing that motivates McPhee, and that is how I'm going to take my revenge.


When Paolo arrived home that evening, he remarked that Mister McPhee was acting in an even stranger manner than usual. He kept giving him strange glances and took great delight him patting him down. He did say one thing that sparked her interest.


“Martha, I wish I had your picnic basket today. I had a rather large nugget stuck in my shoe and they do not check us when we break for lunch. Of course, I declared it to the team leader at the time, but it was a beauty.”


That night Martha could not sleep. Her mind kept flicking back to her being pinned against the tree, and Mcphee’s odorous breath against her ear. Just before dawn, her brain recalled another sentence. “Martha, I wish I had your picnic basket today. "


The next morning, Martha broached Paulo with her plan. “ I'm so sick of the way he treats you. Is not acceptable I've been thinking about what you said, and I will deliver your lunch today. I think you should put any spare nuggets you find into the empty basket and I will collect tomorrow when I bring your lunch”.


Paolo looked at her in bewilderment. He could not believe that his sweet, do- gooder wife would suggest they steal from his employer.


"Martha,are you sure? What about the troopers, who will care for the children if we are caught?”


“He is a vile man and does not deserve your respect Paolo. I will see you at lunchtime” and with that she turned her back and continued her chores.


Martha was as good as her word. At noon she arrived with a covered basket with fresh bread, cold meats and a slab of cheese, all covered in Muslin cloth. Her friend Jenny owned a successful providore in town and was always giving supplies to Martha at discounted rates.


She whispered to Paolo “Wrap it in the cloth” as she handed the basket to him.


“Good day, everybody” she trilled to the assortment of minors, stopping for a break under the shade of a eucalypt tree, as she left the mining camp.


The next day Martha arrived with a similar basket and handed it to her husband. She then recovered the previous day's basket with the discarded cloth wrapped tightly in it.


“Have a nice day, everybody” she called out and went on her way.


Paolo receive some gentle ribbing from his fellow miners who were not used to seeing such devotion in the goldfields. He laughed it off by saying " She wants to prove to my mother that she is a good wife. You know how women can get, trying to outdo each other. She thinks Mama does not approve of her as she is not Italian.”


Martha could not wait to see what would reveal itself once she unfurled the cloth. Paolo had explained to her that he would not find or be able to hide nuggets every day. Sometimes it would only be the fine gold dust called alluvial gold. She was pleasantly surprised to find one teaspoon of the fine dust in the folds of the cloth. She carefully decanted this into an old sardine tin and added some buttons. On the outside she stuck on one of the buttons to indicate the contents were sewing supplies. As she was the only member of the household that knew how to use needle and thread, it was unlikely to be discovered. If somebody picked up the tin by mistake the sound of the buttons rattling would disguise the other contents, especially once they added nuggets to the haul, she reasoned.


Over the next few weeks, Martha fell into a routine of going to the mine arriving just before noon and returning to her children by the heat of the day at 1:00 PM.


The secret stash of gold was steadily increasing. Most days it would be a small amount of alluvial gold, and some days to her delight there was some small nuggets. Martha and Paolo never discussed their gold smuggling operation. It was as if they did not discuss it, it was not happening.


The next problem Martha needed to solve was how to dispose of the gold. The only person she knew that was both trustworthy and well connected was her friend Jenny. Her successful shop attracted buyers and sellers of gold from all backgrounds, and she was sure a useful contact could be found.


“Jenny, do you know if how I can dispose of some gold that has come my way? I did some mending work for one of the miners and he paid me in gold.” Martha invented the story on the spot, she was becoming quite proficient at deceiving people.


Jenny gave her the name of a local gold dealer and assured her he would give her a fair price. “I often get paid in raw material and James has always been very obliging” she added.


Martha contacted James, who exchanged the gold without any questions. He conducted many transactions daily and had learned the hard way not to question the provenance of the mineral.


In the early 1850's the goldfields were undergoing a boom and gold was in abundance. Paolo and Martha quietly gathered a nest egg from their underhanded activities. Paolo was becoming an expert miner and also very adept at hiding some of his finds. He was never greedy but managed to secure a future for himself and his family. This financial security enabled them to not worry about putting healthy food on the table or gave them the ability to fetch the doctor if a family member was sick. Doctors were in high demand during this time and would only attend families that could guarantee payment.


The hardest decision they had to make was how to upgrade their small hut without drawing attention to themselves. Everyone knew that Paolo worked for McPhee and he should not be able to afford the timber cottage that Marsha was coveting. Ballarat was the home of the burgeoning stock market, so they decided to invest in some shares instead of a house. It would not attract as much attention.


Jenny's brother had established himself as a stockbroker and was happy to represent and advise them on potential purchases. Paolo often heard about gold finds or collapsed mines before other punters, and they use this knowledge to pre-empt market movements.


Over the next two years Paolo and Martha's investments had grown significantly. Unfortunately, Paolo’s health had not had the same luck. Long hours hunched down a dark mine was starting to take a toll on his back, lungs and eyesight. He was also starting to think about what was in store for his family's future. Would the goldfields offer an education and career opportunity to his sons? Immigrants in the goldfields tended to stay in their own communities but his children were mixed race.


Paolo and Martha eventually made the difficult decision to move from Ballarat and established themselves in Melbourne. Martha was nervous but excited about the move, as she had her heart set on a house in one of the newly established Bayside communities to raise her family.


On Paolo’s last day at the mine, Martha delivered his lunch as usual. As she departed with her basket snuggled into her elbow, she looked Mr McPhee in the eye and said “You are a vile, despicable human and deserve everything that happens to you”, and then she spat on the ground in front of him. The sight of this elegant miner’s wife cursing him with such vehemence would stay with him for a long time.

Martha continued “I took him lunch every single day and that is how we smuggled the gold out.”


Maggie gulped and looked at her mother “You did what?” She asked hesitantly.


“Oh yes, I smuggled the gold out. Every day your father would wrap up either gold dust or nuggets of gold in muslin cloth and I would collect it and sell it in town. After that, he would tell me which shares to buy and I would purchase them at The Corner. At one time, I was the best known woman stock trader in Ballarat.”


Maggie could not believe what she was hearing. Had her entire upbringing been built on the proceeds of crime. Could she morally accept this? Should she keep everything after her mother passed away?


Martha continued lucidly. “Your father's boss assaulted me and treated him like a servant, he paid him a pittance, hit him like a dog and stole his health. We only took what was rightfully ours”.


Then she returned to her rambling “I took him his lunch every day" she repeated.


Maggie decided all of this must have been the rampant imagination of an old lady, but then again how did they afford their beautiful house? She decided that she did not want to know. `

    description:`Two Gentlemen of Verona

by Debra Tillar


In fair Verona town one festive day

As flags and cheers and trumpets rent the air,

Party boats festooned the waterway

And singing crowds adorned the central square.


The regiment had rallied in the street,

Called to arms and ordered to defend

Their northern border cities and defeat

The French aggressors to the bitter end.


With hope and pride the town folk celebrated

The soldiers as they mustered for the cause.

With kisses, handshakes, hugs unmoderated,

Roses, garlands, fanfare, songs, applause.


On this otherwise auspicious morn,

As dancers gamboled with a boisterous band,

Young Julie bowed her head and wept forlorn,

The pain of heart was more than she could stand.


Her love, the handsome Lonzo, finely hewn,

Proudly wielding helmet, sword, and shield,

Stood there brave and bold with his platoon

And readied for the march as church bells pealed.


“Don’t leave me, cara mio!” Julie cried.

But Lonzo scoffed and kissed her dulcet cheek.

“Don’t make a fuss,” he said with wounded pride.

“The French bâtards will yield within a week!”


Across Piàzza D’Oro in the crowd,

Sweet Rosamond revealed her strong emotion

To Niccolo and unto him she vowed

Her constancy, her love, and her devotion.


Like Lonzo, Niccolo was hardly moved.

He smiled and tipped his cap and gave a wink.

His love for Rosamond was hardly proved;

He really couldn’t care what she might think.


The two young women harbored some suspicions.

Of course they feared the safety of their dears

But rumors said the boys had some ambitions,

That they had plans to exercise their spears.


Most legionnaires were eager for crusades,

But certain young men marched for other reasons.

Their purpose to seek wanton escapades,

To sample other sauces, other seasons.


They mused of meals with women thickly sliced,

Desserts with lips that taste of caramels.

Were told they’d find such things quite hotly spiced

In the arms of eager mademoiselles.


The hour came and off the troops paraded,

Headed for a French provincial town

That didn’t know it soon would be invaded

By men who sought a merciless beat down.


The Veronese raised hands in exaltation

And praised their heroes on in adulation!


Some months passed by, the war was far from over,

Soldiers wounded, dead, and MIA.

Were Niccolo and Lonzo pushing clover

Or biding time in some French cabaret?


Rosamond and Julie met one night

Wandering each alone along the river.

They shared their dread for those who’d gone to fight—

Catastrophes and qualms that made them quiver.


“I write to Lonzo yet I get no letter,”

Julie used her sleeve to dab her eye.

“I fear he’s dead and yet I do know better.

A missive would be sent if he should die.”


“From Niccolo I also get no word.

But after all they’re fighting in a war.

It might be that they think it too absurd,

That taking time to write is just a bore.”


“Yet other men at war don’t feel that way,”

Julie said with anger and frustration.

“Letters come from soldiers every day.

Righteous men don’t fear communication.


“I love my Lonzo but there is no trust,

His vanity and looks have caused me pain.

I’ve heard that Niccolo gives in to lust,

That our beloveds wonts are much the same.”


Rosamond took heed and thought a moment.

She’d ascertain the truth were she a man.

And in her head an escapade did foment;

She shared with Julie her ambitious plan.


“There is a way to prove our lovers’ worth,

Ease our hearts and allay our suspicions.

Come with me, I promise we’ll unearth

The truth about those rascals’ dispositions!”


The ladies gathered everything they’d need:

The clothes, the tools, the mules they’d have to ride,

Convinced that with this plan they guaranteed

Their dreads and fears would soon be satisfied.


Cunningly they glued on large moustaches,

They cut their hair and put on soldiers’ pants,

And bound their breasts and trimmed back their eyelashes

Then went to join the army, still in France.


They galloped off, so brave and bold and clever,

Determined to complete their shrewd endeavor!


Meanwhile, war with France was not proceeding,

Hostilities had trickled down to nil.

Both sides sent reports that were misleading,

In truth they hated war, they liked to chill!


The French and Veronese had soon decided

The joys of life were preferable to war,

And found the local villages provided

Amusement that would boost esprit de corps!


Now daily both the armies joined together,

In search of drink and ladies of the night

To help them doff their chainmail and their leather

With thirsts no better than a troglodyte.


Niccolo and Lonzo were out sousing,

Joined by six or seven other men.

The soldiers had a knack for lewd carousing

In any local bawdy house or den.


Two young amichi came and asked to join

Their kinsmen in pursuit of carnal lust.

They showed they had the craving and the coin;

They drank, they spit, they scratched their balls, they cussed.


Now incognito, Rosamund and Julie

Played along as if they both were men.

At times festivities became unruly—

Julie rode like an equestrienne!


The prostituta knew at once the caper,

But being paid gave neither lass away.

The busy hands and fiddlings did not taper;

The feckless men did not suspect foul play.


“Lonzo never touched me quite like this,”

Julie whispered soft to Rosamond.

“I’m starting to suspect what I have missed,

A lifestyle that in past I surely shunned.”


Rosamond just smiled but she said nothing,

Watching Niccolo deep-dish his pie.

Much excessive moaning, huff and puffing—

Not much to respect or dignify.


And when they’d seen enough the ladies leapt:

“Fie! You rutting goats, you three-inch fools!

Rot in hell!” they shouted, then they stepped

Out the door to mount their stalwart mules.


“I think those soldiers’ insults were unfair,”

Lonzo said, and gave his ‘stache a twirl.

“Don’t know who they are and I don’t care.

“I just hope that they don’t tell my girl!”


Niccolo had hardly paid attention

So focused as he was on his pursuit.

His brain had withered to incomprehension,

He couldn’t get his mind off his cheroot!


The gals left town without a backward glance,

Satisfied to know the outcome of

The short but fruitful time they’d spent in France

Had changed their notions of romantic love.


“I really liked that lady,” said sweet Julie.

“I never knew that sex could be so fine.”

“Agreed!” said Rosamond, then added cruelly:

“Niccolò—his moves were asinine!”


“This journey has confirmed our worst suspicions,”

They both admitted as they rode away.

“And yet despite the lurid expositions,

Our hearts are fine and feeling rather gay!”


And so at journey’s end they both agreed

That they were better off! Goodnight indeed!`
